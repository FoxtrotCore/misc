ODD: Woohoo!
ODD: You’re really doing\Na great job, Jeremie!
ODD: XANA better be\Nbehaving himself
ODD: now that we’ve\Ngot these things!
ODD: Whoa!
ODD: Hah ha!
JEREMIE: Be careful all the same!
ODD: Don’t worry, Einstein.\NI know how to ride!
ODD: No way I’m gonna\Nlet Ulrich beat me!
ODD: Wahoo!
ULRICH: Oh, no you don’t.
DEFAULT: (ENGINE REVVING)
ODD: Hah ha!
JEREMIE: Odd, I didn’t have time
JEREMIE: to perfect the program\Nthat calculates trajectory!
ODD: Yeah!
ODD: Huh?
ODD: (YELLS)
ULRICH: (CHUCKLES)
YUMI: Odd!\N
AELITA: Are you okay?\N
ODD: Oh, yeah.
ODD: There’s still some work to do\Non the Overboard, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Maybe it’s the rider\Nwho needs the work!
ULRICH: What happened, Odd?\N You miss a step?
ULRICH: (CACKLES)
ODD: Very funny.
ODD: I’d like to see you\Non an Overboard!
ULRICH: I guess surfing’s\Nnot my thing.
JEREMIE: Uh, sorry to interrupt your\Nfascinating conversation,
JEREMIE: but it looks like XANA\Nhas spotted you.
JEREMIE: There’s something\Ncoming your way!
DEFAIULT: (BEEPING)
JEREMIE: But that’s really weird.\N
JEREMIE: I…I can’t tell what it is.
YUMI: Hey.\N
YUMI: what’s that?\N
ULRICH: I don’t know, but it\Nlooks like trouble.
ULRICH: Big time.
AELITA: I’ve never seen a monster\Nlike that one before.
AELITA: XANA must’ve just created it.
JEREMIE: In any case, it says here
JEREMIE: that it’s got more life points\Nthan the others.
DEFAULT: (GASPS)
DEFAULT: (SCREECHING)
YUMI: Jeremie, how about\Nreprogramming our vehicles?
JEREMIE: I’m on it already.\NBut it’s gonna take time.
ULRICH: On my signal.\N
YUMI: I’ll go first\N
ODD: And I’m gonna keep it busy.
ULRICH: Now!
JEREMIE: Aelita, there’s a deactivated\Ntower not far away.
JEREMIE: Direction -- north by northwest.
JEREMIE: Get out of there and\Ncome and meet me,
JEREMIE: but hurry up!
ODD: Hey, you overgrown spider!
ODD: Looking for me?
DEFAULT: (SCREECHES)
JEREMIE: Odd, you just lost 20 life points.
JEREMIE: It’s got a powerful laser!
ODD: What does it take\Nto destroy this thing?
JEREMIE: Vehicles ready.
ODD: Well, it’s about time!
JEREMIE: Come on! I’m doing my best!
ODD: Let me go first.
YUMI: Go on.\N We’ll be watching you.
ODD: Laser arrows!
ODD: This thing is really unbeatable!
YUMI: Need a hand?
ODD: Laser arrows!
DEFAULT: (SCREECHES)
JEREMIE: If XANA’s gonna start\Nprogramming new monsters,
JEREMIE: it means our troubles, guys,\Nhave only just begun.
ODD: Anyway, Einstein,\None thing is sure --
ODD: you’re gonna have to\Nprogram our vehicles faster.
ODD: Otherwise, we don’t stand a chance\Nagainst those tarantulas!
YUMI: Your aunt what?
ODD: Tarantulas! The new monsters.
ODD: I like to give my enemies a name.
JEREMIE: What worries me is\Nthat our friend, XANA,
JEREMIE: has obviously found a way\Nto increase his power.
ULRICH: You think he’s still evolving?
JEREMIE: Maybe so.
JEREMIE: In any case, from now on,
JEREMIE: we have to be ready for\Nanything and everything.
AELITA: Maybe I’d better\Nget back to Lyoko.
AELITA: If XANA activates a tower,\NI’d better be there.
JEREMIE: Uh, should we tell her?
AELITA: Hm?
YUMI: Well, of course\Nwe should tell her!
YUMI: Why keep good news\Nlike that a secret?
AELITA: Keep what a secret?
AELITA: Would someone please\Ntell me what’s going on?
JEREMIE: Over the past few weeks,\NI’ve spent all of my time
JEREMIE: developing the vehicles and\Nan antivirus to free you from XANA,
JEREMIE: and I also perfected\Na whole new program
JEREMIE: for detecting activated towers.
ODD: A super scanner!
ODD: Much more accurate\Nthan the old one.
JEREMIE: With instant detection.
JEREMIE: Meaning -- you don’t have to\Nstay on Lyoko all the time!
AELITA: So I’m gonna live…
ULRICH: Here. With us.
ULRICH: We’ve already enrolled you\Nas a boarder at the school.
YUMI: Everything’s all set up.
YUMI: We wanted to surprise you.
AELITA: I…

AELITA: Aelita Stones.
AELITA: Like the rock group.
AELITA: I’m Odd’s cousin from Canada.
JIM: Oh.
JIM: So, Aelita, breakfast\Nstarts at 7 AM,
JIM: and dinner’s at 7 PM.
JIM: It’s against the rules\Nto be in your room
JIM: between 8 AM and 4:30 PM
JIM: You can ask your friends,
JIM: Della Robbia,\NStern, and Belpois,
JIM: to fill you in on\Nthe rest of the rules.
JIM: That is, if they can\Nremember them.
JIM: Hmph.
MRS. HERTZ: I don’t want to\Nhear another word
