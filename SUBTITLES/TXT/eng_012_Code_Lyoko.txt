YUMI: (LAUGHS)
ODD: Ulrich, watch out!
JEREMIE: Ulrich, are you okay?

ODD: And can you tell us\Nwho the lucky lady is?
ULRICH: You’ve gotta be kidding.\NI’m not telling anyone.

YUMI: Oh, yeah? Who is Emily flipped over?
ODD: It’s Jim! Emily’s crazy about Jim.

YUMI: Oh! I’m, uh, I’m s-sorry.
KIWI: (BARKS)
KIWI: (WHIMPERS)

ULRICH: Hey, what’s that all about, huh?
ODD: I don’t know!
ULRICH: And then I heard this buzzing\Ncoming from the trees.
ULRICH: There must be dangerous insects up there.
MR. DELMAS: Thanks for the information, Ulrich.\NI’ll take care of it.
MR. ROUILER: (MAN SCREAMING)
MR. ROUILER: Help! Help! Get them off!
ULRICH: We’ll try to attract them to us!
ULRICH: Let’s go!

ODD: What about Ulrich?
JEREMIE: He’ll take care of them.
YUMI: Head that way! Hurry!

YUMI: Oh, it’s nothing serious, Ulrich.
YUMI: Just a scratch.
YUMI: Uh, I think we can go now.
ULRICH: Well?
JEREMIE: Mister Bennett was lucky.\NOne more bite, and…
ODD: Yeah, that’s right,\Nbut he’s still not in great shape.
JEREMIE: The principal sent for help.\NThey’re gonna get rid of the nest.
JEREMIE: I don’t know what you guys think, but I…
ODD: But you think it’s XANA.\NCome on, cut it out.
ODD: Hornet’s nests have always been around,\Nand accidents happen all the time!
ULRICH: You’re right, but these hornets,\Nthey were after us and nobody else.
YUMI: Well, I say we check it out.
JEREMIE: I’ll try to contact Aelita.
YUMI: I’m going back to class,\Nbut keep me posted.
ODD: Do you realize the damage\Nthese bugs can cause?
ODD: There are thousands of them!
ODD: If XANA is in on this attack,
ODD: we could have a very\Nserious problem, huh?
ODD: Don’t you think so?
ODD: Hello!
ULRICH: Uh, what?
ULRICH: Uh, yeah! Right!\NI mean, I don't know.
ODD: Ulrich, you wouldn’t\Nhappen to have a crush
ODD: on this secret admirer\Nof yours, would you?
ODD: Hm, Ulrich?
ODD: Hm?
ULRICH: Yeah, you could be right.
EMILY: (CLEARS THROAT)
EMILY: What’s all this about me\Nbeing in love with Jim?
ODD: Uh…
EMILY: Start that rumor again,
EMILY: and even your dog\Nwon’t recognize you!
JEREMIE: Aelita, do you read me?
AELITA: Loud and clear.\NHow are things in the real world?
JEREMIE: We’ve got a problem.\NAnd we think it might be XANA.
JEREMIE: Have you noticed anything?
AELITA: No. At least here in\Nthe desert, things are calm.
AELITA: But if you want I can\Ncheck out the other regions.
JEREMIE: Good idea.
JEREMIE: And in the meantime,
JEREMIE: I’ll run a scan to see if\Nthere’s an activated tower.
JEREMIE: There it is.
JEREMIE: Aelita, the scanner spotted
JEREMIE: an activated tower in the forest
AELITA: Okay. I’m in the forest now.\NI’ll try to find it.
JEREMIE: I’ll tell the others.
: (RINGING)
JEREMIE: Alert!
JEREMIE: XANA has activated a tower,\Nand Aelita’s trying to find it, guys.
YUMI: It looks as if something’s up.
YUMI: Jeremie wants us to\Ngo to the factory right now.
ULRICH: No--no, wait, Yumi.
ULRICH: I wanted to, uh,\Nto tell you something.
ULRICH: It’s about your…\Nabout your letter.
YUMI: Huh? But--
ULRICH: No, let me finish.
ULRICH: You said in the letter that…
ULRICH: that you had certain\Nfeelings for me, and…
YUMI: Huh?
ULRICH: I wanted you to know that…\Nthat I feel the same thing for you.
ULRICH: There. I’ve said it.
YUMI: But I never sent you any letter, Ulrich.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
HERB: Oh, that has got to hurt!
SISSI: Kind of embarrassing if you ask me!
SISSI: (CACKLES)
YUMI: Forget them. Don’t worry.
ULRICH: I don’t care. Leave me alone!
YUMI: But…
JEREMIE: Oh, no!
JEREMIE: Oh, wow. Nice going, XANA.
ODD: Jeremie, any suggestions\Nwould be very welcome.
JEREMIE: Uh, get away from here\Nas fast as we can?
JEREMIE: We’re trapped!
ODD: Hey, you got any other ideas?
JEREMIE: Jump!
ODD: (COUGHING)
JEREMIE: Come on.
ODD: This is your idea?
JEREMIE: Insects are very sensitive to smells.
ODD: They’re not the only ones, huh?
ODD: Eugh.
ODD: Hey, I think it worked!
JEREMIE: Looks like it.
ODD: What do you know?
YUMI: What’s that smell?
ODD: Ask Jeremie.
JEREMIE: We left you a message.\NDidn’t you get it?
ULRICH: What do you think?
ULRICH: I didn’t feel like checking my messages.
YUMI: Look, I think we should talk.
ULRICH: I know what you’re gonna tell me,\Nand I don’t wanna hear it.
YUMI: Ulrich, this is all\Non account of Sissi!
ULRICH: Don’t you think I know that?
ULRICH: But because of her, I’m confused.
ULRICH: Every time I see you,\NI don’t know what to think.
ULRICH: So just leave me alone, okay?
JEREMIE: He’s losing it.
JEREMIE: Aelita?
JEREMIE: Are you okay?
AELITA: Yes, I found the activated tower.
AELITA: But it’s guarded. I can’t access it.
JEREMIE: Don’t worry. Help is on the way.
ODD: Hey, guys, hold on a minute!
ODD: The bugs have blocked\Nthe factory entrance,
ODD: and I would rather\Nstay out of that sewer.
JEREMIE: Don’t worry, Odd.
JEREMIE: I’m way ahead of you on this one.
ODD: Well, what’s the deal?
DEFAULT: (BEEPING)
ODD: Bingo!
JEREMIE: Pretty clever, huh?
JEREMIE: This thing generates ultrasounds\Nof about thirty thousand hertz.
JEREMIE: Like all insects, hornets\Nare capable of receiving the--
YUMI: Fascinating, but we\Ndon’t have time, so let’s move!
DEFAULT: (STUDENTS SCREAM)
FIREFIGHTER: Get inside!
FIREFIGHTER: Come on, hurry up!
FIREFIGHTER: Headquarters, we’ve got a problem.
FIREFIGHTER: We’re at the junior high school, right.
ULRICH: Your thing stopped! How come?
JEREMIE: Battery’s dead.
ULRICH: What!?
DEFAULT: Hurry up!
JEREMIE: Okay, here we go.
JEREMIE: Aelita, do you read me?
JEREMIE: We’re on our way. Hang in there!
JEREMIE: No time to lose. To the forest!
JEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Transfer Yumi.
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE: Hurry! Hurry!
JEREMIE: Scanner Odd.
JEREMIE: Scanner Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Scanner Yumi.
JEREMIE: Virtualization!
JEREMIE: Come in, Aelita.
JEREMIE: Aelita, answer me!
JEREMIE: Oh, no. This cannot be happening!
JEREMIE: Do you see her?
YUMI: No, not yet.
SISSI: Oh, and talk about\Nembarrassing situations,
SISSI: I’m sure that Ulrich’s not about\Nto forget this for a long time.
SISSI: What a genius I am!
SISSI: You could say something.
SISSI: A-a-a-aah!
HERB: Wait up!
JEREMIE: Careful. Three swarms of\NHornets converging.
JEREMIE: Get ready.
ODD: Laser arrow!
JEREMIE: Less than 20 life points left, Yumi.
JEREMIE: Be careful, Odd!
JEREMIE: Odd, 80 life points left.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, what are you doing?
JEREMIE: Odd, two enemies at three o’clock!
ODD: Laser arrow!
YUMI: Aelita!
YUMI: Aelita!
JEREMIE: No, Yumi! Aelita!
JEREMIE: Aelita, are you okay?
AELITA: Yes. I’m fine, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Yumi, in front of you!
JEREMIE: Yeah!
JEREMIE: Watch it! They’re coming back.
JEREMIE: Yumi, you’ve only got\N20 life points left.
ODD: Ulrich, wake up!
DEFAULT: Odd!
JEREMIE: Odd, you have hardly\Nany life points left.
ODD: Now!
ODD: (PANTING)
YUMI: Ulrich, are you with us or not?
YUMI: I know you’re unhappy,\Nbut there’s no reason to be.
YUMI: Our friendship’s\Nstronger than that, right?
YUMI: You can’t let Sissi’s dirty tricks\Nbreak us up, can you?
YUMI: So forget all about that,\Nplease. We need your help!
ULRICH: You two head for the tower.
ULRICH: I’ll take care of them.
JEREMIE: Well, it’s about time.
ULRICH: Triangulate!
ULRICH: Impact!
AELITA: Yumi!
JEREMIE: Oh, no!
ODD: Go on, Aelita!
ULRICH: Hiyah! Impact!
JEREMIE: Ulrich, you’re the greatest.
DEFAULT: (SCREAMING)
SISSI: Aaah! Go away!
SISSI: No, no! Help!
JEREMIE: Return to the past now.
SISSI: Uh…uh, hi!
SISSI: Uh, I was just passing by, and I…
ULRICH: What do ya know?
ULRICH: Let’s see now.
SISSI: It’s, uh…
YUMI: Well, that’s a pretty\Nembarrassing situation,
YUMI: don’t you think?
SISSI: I, uh, this wasn’t the right door!
YUMI: It sure isn’t!
YUMI: Why not give it to Nicholas or Herb?
YUMI: They’d be delighted!
YUMI: (LAUGHS)
