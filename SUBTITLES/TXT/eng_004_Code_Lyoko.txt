ODD: Hey, Ulrich, what are you looking for?
ODD: I’m hungry!
ULRICH: You go have breakfast.\NThere’s something I have to find.
ODD: Okay.
ULRICH: I can’t believe this.
ODD: (SIGHS)
ODD: Eight slices of toast and three bananas.
ODD: Not bad, huh?
ODD: Hey, are you skipping gym class again?
JEREMIE: Yup.
JEREMIE: It gives me time to work on\NAelita’s materialization.
ULRICH: What’s wrong?
ULRICH: Afraid the wall’s gonna crumble?
SISSI: Ha. Very funny.
SISSI: Can we talk for a second?
SFX: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
ODD: Hi, Yumi!
YUMI: Hello.
YUMI: Hey, look over there. It’s Ulrich.
ODD: But…what’s he doing with Sissi?
ODD: Hey, Ulrich!
SISSI: So?
ULRICH: Hey, that’s blackmail.
ULRICH: Why do you expect me to give in to that?
SISSI: First of all, because it’s hard to say no\Nto a pretty girl like me.
SISSI: And second of all,\NI’m not going to give you any choice.
SISSI: (CACKLES)
: Come on! Come on!
MR. FUMET: In the 17th century, all european states\Nwere governed by either a king or a prince.
: They ruled over mainly peasant populations.
ODD: Hey, what’s going on with them?
ODD: I’m seeing things.
ODD: Ulrich and SissI? That’s weird.
ODD: On the brighter side,\Ncheck out how jealous Herb is!
MR. FUMET: Odd?
MR. FUMET: Are you listening to me, Odd?
MR. FUMET: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
ODD: We have some important\Nthings to talk about, Sissi.
ODD: Come on, hurry up!
SISSI: Hey! But…
JEREMIE: Do you mind explaining?
ULRICH: Okay, here goes.
ULRICH: I’m in a…
: I’m in a jam. Big time.
ULRICH: For years I’ve, uh, been keeping a diary.
JEREMIE: A what?
ULRICH: A diary!
ULRICH: Sissi found it, and now she’s blackmailing me.
ULRICH: I have to go out with her.
ULRICH: If she thinks she’ll win me over\Nthat way, she’s wrong.
JEREMIE: Hold on a second.
JEREMIE: In this diary of yours,\Ndid you talk about XANA or Lyoko?
ULRICH: Well, yeah, and if I\Ndon’t do what Sissi says,
ULRICH: she’s gonna tell everybody.
ULRICH: I don’t know what to do.
JEREMIE: Don’t worry, Ulrich.
JEREMIE: While you’re all at the pool,\NYumi and I will look around.
JEREMIE: We’ll find your diary. You’ll see.
SISSI: The answer is no!
SISSI: The last time! I did not have a nose job!
: So stop asking, huh!
ULRICH: Cut it out, Odd. Leave her alone, will ya?
JEREMIE: It’s nothing. I’ll explain.
JIM: Take a look, Odd.
JIM: Not bad, huh?
JIM: This bus is the latest in modern technology.
JIM: It’s electricity-driven so it’s\Nnon-polluting, but powerful, too.
ODD: Electric and powerful, too, huh?
ODD: I’ll bet you this crate\Ngoes about as fast as a snail.
MUSIC: (SINISTER MUSIC)
BUS DRIVER: What the! Huh?
JIM: Come on, come on. All aboard, now.
JIM: Go sit down, kid.
JIM: Okay, what’s the prob?
JIM: What is that!
BUS DRIVER: I have no idea!
JIM: Sit back down and stay there\Nuntil we get to the pool!
YUMI: Sissi is blackmailing him?
JEREMIE: Yeah. Incredible, huh?
JEREMIE: What matters now though\Nis to find Ulrich’s diary
JEREMIE: before she starts\Nblabbing about Lyoko.
YUMI: I’ll go through her room.
YUMI: And I’ll call you if I need any help.
JEREMIE: I’ll be at the factory.
YUMI: Good luck.
JEREMIE: It’s Jeremie here, Aelita.\NDo you copy?
JEREMIE: Aelita?
AELITA: I’m here, Jeremie.
AELITA: I was waiting for you to call.
AELITA: In the meantime, I was studying\Nyour world a little more.
AELITA: There are so many\Nstrange things to discover.
JEREMIE: Odd, what’s up? Huh?
JEREMIE: Something strange?
JEREMIE: What bus?
SISSI: Isn’t this nice and cozy?
ODD: We’re zipping along at two miles an hour.
BUS DRIVER: I don’t believe this!
BUS DRIVER: I got it floored, and it just refuses to move!
JEREMIE: Okay, I’ll launch a scan on Lyoko.\NI’ll call you if I find something.
ODD: Okay. Got you.
YUMI: Aha.
YUMI: Bingo.
YUMI: Oh, no.
YUMI: This is not Ulrich’s handwriting.
YUMI: Oh, wow! It’s Sissi’s!
YUMI: “I’m tired of his acting\Nas if I don’t even exist.
YUMI: “I can’t stand watching him\Npay so much attention to Yumi…”
SISSI: So, while he was in the lunchroom,
SISSI: I went looking around.
SISSI: I just wanted a picture of him,
SISSI: but I found much better than that.
SISSI: Now, he can’t possibly turn me down.
SISSI: I know what I’m doing isn’t very nice,
SISSI: but it’s the only way I can\Nget him to stop ignoring me.
YUMI: Of all the nasty tricks.
JEREMIE: Yumi, did you find Ulrich’s diary?
YUMI: No, but guess what. I found Sissi’s.
YUMI: You were right. She knows about Lyoko.
YUMI: She doesn’t really understand what it is,
YUMI: but she’s ready to use what she knows.
JEREMIE: Rats. Look, you’ve got to find Ulrich’s diary before they come back from the pool.
YUMI: Don’t worry. I know how to get hold of it.
SISSI: Hey, what if I ask my father\Nif we can go to a movie tonight?
SISSI: That’d be cool, huh?
ULRICH: Huh?
SISSI: Huh!?
SISSI: I’m being nice to you right now,\Nbut if you keep ignoring me,
SISSI: it just might not last, you hear?
SISSI: A little friendly advice--
SISSI: pay attention to me,\Nor the whole school’s gonna read your diary.
ULRICH: Okay, okay. You don’t have to threaten me.
ULRICH: I know exactly what I’m risking.
SISSI: Oh, yeah?
SISSI: You really think so, Ulrich?
SFX: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
SISSI: Hello?
SISSI: Oh, Yumi.
SISSI: What do you want?
YUMI: Well, uh, I wanted to tell you\Nhow much I like your style.
YUMI: “I ran into that dipstick Jim today!
YUMI: "What an idiot he looks like\N}in that sweaty gym suit of his!”
SISSI: Okay, okay! What do you want?
YUMI: Tell me where you’ve got\NUlrich’s diary hidden.
YUMI: And hurry up,\Nor all your nasty little secrets
YUMI: will be on page one of the school paper.
SISSI: Okay, okay!
SISSI: If you go into the girl’s bathroom,
SISSI: it’s in the third stall on the\Ntop of the water tank, you got that?
YUMI: Okay, I’ll go and check.
SISSI: Wait! What about my diary!
SISSI: What…
ULRICH: Thanks a lot, Yumi!
ULRICH: There, you see?
ULRICH: It’s good to have real friends, isn’t it?
HERB: It’s about time.
HERB: I thought that guy\Nwould never get off your back.
SISSI: If you know what’s good for you, shut up!
MR. CHARDIN: Yumi, what are you doing there?
YUMI: Nothing, sir!
YUMI: I felt sick, but I’m fine now!
JEREMIE: Aelita?
AELITA: Jeremie, Odd and Ulrich were right.
AELITA: XANA’s at it again.
AELITA: The pulsations are getting stronger.
JEREMIE: Aelita, the activated tower is in the desert.
AELITA: I’m off.
BUS DRIVER: What’s going on now? This is weird!
SFX: (SCREAMING)
JIM: Hey, get back to your seats!
JIM: You’re not allowed to get up!
ULRICH: What’s going on with this bus?
BUS DRIVER: That, kid, I wish I knew!
BUS DRIVER: All I know is it’s out of control!
ULRICH: Hey, it seemed to be working okay\Nbefore you recharged the batteries, right?
BUS DRIVER: Yeah, everything was just fine.
BUS DRIVER: But now I can’t…
JEREMIE: Ulrich, what’s happening, huh?
ULRICH: We’re in trouble.
ULRICH: XANA has taken complete control of the bus.
JEREMIE: Okay. Give me a sec.
JEREMIE: I wonder what XANA’s trying to do.
JEREMIE: Where are you?
ULRICH: At the corner of Washington Street\Nand Franklin Avenue.
JEREMIE: I’ll call you back\Nas soon as I can localize you.
ULRICH: We’re in for a rough ride.
ODD: Aelita’s gonna need a hand on Lyoko.
ODD: We’ve got to go.
ULRICH: Then you go.
ULRICH: I’ll stay here.
SFX: (GRUNTING)
ULRICH: Take off your backpacks\Nand use them as airbags!
JEREMIE: Yumi, things are getting tough here.
JEREMIE: Come straight to the factory after class.
YUMI: Right.
JIM: Now hurry up and get your\Nseat belts fastened!
BUS DRIVER: Come on, kid, take it easy.
BUS DRIVER: Just calm down, huh?
BUS DRIVER: Does the little girl need any help?
SISSI: No thanks.
SISSI: The little girl can take care of herself.
ULRICH: We’ve just gone through\Nthe Constellation intersection, okay?
JEREMIE: Don’t worry, Ulrich.
JEREMIE: I’ve got you spotted now.
JEREMIE: But I still don’t understand\Nwhat XANA is trying to do.
AELITA: I can see it, Jeremie.
AELITA: I’ve got a virtual image of the activated tower.
JEREMIE: Well done, Aelita.
JEREMIE: Stay where you are. Yumi is on her way.
JEREMIE: Hurry in the scan!\NThe situation is getting worse!
JEREMIE: Transfer Yumi.
JEREMIE: Scanner.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
AELITA: Yumi! Yumi!
JEREMIE: Crazy!
JEREMIE: Ulrich, XANA is launching the bus\Non the petrochemical complex!
ULRICH: He’s what?
JIM: How’s that!
JIM: There’s no way to stop this infernal thing!
BUS DRIVER: We don’t have any choice. We have to jump.
BUS DRIVER: Now look what you’ve done, huh!
BUS DRIVER: By cutting the cables, you blocked the door!
ULRICH: Jim, Jeremie thinks we’re headed\Nstraight for the petrochemical plant.
JIM: You mind telling me how he knows that?
ULRICH: Uh…we’ll tell you that later,\Nbut for now you just have to trust him.
ULRICH: He can help us.
JIM: Okay, okay.
SISSI: Uh, Ulrich…
SISSI: Well, I’m really sorry about your diary.
SISSI: It was wrong to take it.
SISSI: Please forgive me.
SISSI: Can I help in any way?
ULRICH: Here. Take this.
ULRICH: You can be the go-between\Nfor Jeremie and me.
JEREMIE: Yumi, Aelita, the tower is real close now.
YUMI: No, wait. This is too easy.
YUMI: Coming all this way\Nwithout seeing even one monster?
YUMI: There’s got to be a trap.
AELITA: A sandstorm!
YUMI: It’s a tornado!
YUMI: Jeremie, we’ve got a problem here.
JEREMIE: Make that two.
JEREMIE: There’s a monster behind you!
POLICE OFFICER #1: Calling all cars.
POLICE OFFICER #1: All cars, I said. Calling all cars.
JEREMIE: In 10 seconds, the bus should bear left.
SISSI: He says we’re gonna turn left.
ULRICH: Everybody over here with me.
JIM: Maybe we should jump off the bus.
JIM: W-What do you think?
JIM: It might just be the best idea.
JIM: That way at least we won’t go\Ncrashing into the petrochemical plant.
SISSI: At that speed,\Nthere’s no way we could survive.
ULRICH: Give me that.
ULRICH: Jeremie, how are things going back at Lyoko?
JEREMIE: Aelita and Yumi are almost at the tower,
JEREMIE: except that they’re caught in a sandstorm.
ULRICH: Okay, we’ll wait a little longer.
JEREMIE: Yumi, be careful at the ridge.
JEREMIE: If Aelita falls into the digital sea,\Nshe’ll be lost forever.
JEREMIE: Yumi! Careful in front of you!
JEREMIE: It’s a megatank!
YUMI: Get up! Hurry!
YUMI: Whoa!
YUMI: XANA set a trap for us.
SFX: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
JEREMIE: Good work, Aelita!
JEREMIE: Odd, hurry to the scan.
JEREMIE: You’ll be reaching the complex in 10 minutes.
JEREMIE: Careful! You’re gonna turn left again.
SISSI: Everyone to the right!
AELITA: Yumi!
JEREMIE: Hide, Aelita!
JEREMIE: And don’t move until Odd\Nis there with you, understand!
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE: Scanner.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
ODD: Aelita!
ODD: Hey, Aelita!
ODD: Aelita!
AELITA: Welcome to our world!
AELITA: Hey, Odd! Odd!
ODD: Okay, let’s go to work, Aelita.
AELITA: Thank you, Odd.
ULRICH: Listen, we only have four minutes left\Nbefore we get to the complex.
ULRICH: How are things going on Lyoko?
JEREMIE: Okay. Aelita and Odd are handling it.
JEREMIE: Careful, there’s a ridge!
ODD: Huh?
ODD: I have an idea. Follow me.
AELITA: Odd, you’re out of your mind!
JEREMIE: Hurry up now, Aelita!
ULRICH: What’s the matter?
ULRICH: Don’t you like it here, Jim?
SISSI: Oh, no! We’re gonna crash!
ULRICH: It’s all over for us.
ULRICH: It’s too late.
JEREMIE: Well, it was close.
JEREMIE: But we did it!
JEREMIE: Now, are you ready to go back in time?
ULRICH: Huh?
YUMI: Here. I didn’t read it.
YUMI: I swear, Ulrich.
ULRICH: I’ll tell you about it one day, Yumi.
YUMI: I’d really like that.
ULRICH: I’d better go.
ULRICH: I wouldn’t want to miss Sissi.
ULRICH: Sissi, were you waiting for me?
ULRICH: Looking for something?
SISSI: Uh…no!
SISSI: I, uh, I was just passing by, so…
ODD: Yes!
