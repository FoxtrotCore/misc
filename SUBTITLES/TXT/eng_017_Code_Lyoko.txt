MRS. HERTZ: Here we have the nanosphere
MRS. HERTZ: that he nanotech services company\Nwas kind enough to lend us.
MRS. HERTZ: Who can tell us\Nwhat nanotechnology is?
MRS. HERTZ: Jeremie, go on.
JEREMIE: It’s microscopic-sized technology.
JEREMIE: There are nano motors,\Nnano circuit boards, and nano gears.
MRS. HERTZ: Exactly.
MRS. HERTZ: In the medical field, for example,\Nscientists are developing nano doctors,
MRS. HERTZ: tiny machines which will be able\Nto travel through our bodies to combat disease.
MRS. HERTZ: Scientific research, however,\Nstill has a long way to go.
SISSI: Are these robots capable of fighting\Npimples, cellulite, and things like that?
MRS. HERTZ: Yes, they can, but the priority\Nis for more serious illnesses.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
ODD: And nanotechnology\Ncan’t do a thing about stupidity!
ODD: Poor Sissi! What a shame!
MRS. HERTZ: All right, now. Quiet down.
MRS. HERTZ: So, this nanosphere is used\Nto make microscopic devices.
MRS. HERTZ: Strange…\Nit hasn’t been cleaned properly.
MRS. HERTZ: There’s gelatin inside.
ULRICH: Looks like the greasy stuff\NOdd puts on his hair every day.
MRS. HERTZ: Well, since you think\Nyou’re so clever, Ulrich,
MRS. HERTZ: why don’t you take a sample\N for us to examine?
MRS. HERTZ: The gelatin is used as a culture\Nwhere nanodevices can develop.
ULRICH: It looks an awful lot like jam.
ODD: Sorry, but I just couldn’t resist!
ULRICH: I’ll get you for that, Odd!
MRS. HERTZ: This is a science class,\Nchildren, not a comedy club!
JEREMIE: Wow, this nanotechnology is incredible.
JEREMIE: Now there’s a field\NI’d like to work on in the future.
YUMI: I have enough trouble\Nwith normal-sized technology,
YUMI: much less microscopic.
ODD: Hey, that looks good!\NCan I have some?
ULRICH: Here.
ULRICH: I warned you!
ODD: Yeah…
: but taking advantage\Nof my sweet tooth wasn’t fair!
ULRICH: I said I’d--
YUMI: Ulrich! What is it?
ULRICH: It’s my head, I--
JIM: What’s going on around here?
YUMI: Ulrich passed out.
JIM: I’ll take him to the infirmary.
JEREMIE: He was just fine this morning.
ODD: I know, it’s really weird.
SISSI: Hmm…
: All right.
YOLANDA: Get some rest now, Ulrich.
YOLANDA: What are you doing here?
SISSI: I wanted to find out how Ulrich was.
YOLANDA: Much better. He’s asleep.
SISSI: Just a second, can I see him?
YOLANDA: I don’t know, I, uh…
SISSI: You see, I’m his best friend!
YOLANDA: Oh, all right, but not for too long.
SISSI: You’re so handsome when you sleep.
ULRICH: Where am I, anyway?
SISSI: In the infirmary. You passed out.
ULRICH: The infirmary?\NWhat infirmary?
ULRICH: Who am I! What’s my name?
SISSI: Uh, Ulrich!
ULRICH: Ulrich?
SISSI: You must’ve hit your head\Nwhen you fell down.
ULRICH: And who are you?
SISSI: Me? I’m Sissi.
SISSI: Sissi!
SISSI: Your sweetheart!
SISSI: Watch it!
SISSI: Well, Ulrich,
: when are you gonna admit\Nyou’re mad about me, huh?
ULRICH: You’re kidding…
ULRICH: I’m allergic to anyone who’s conceited!
ULRICH: You’re your own favorite fan club!
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
ULRICH: My sweetheart?
YOLANDA: Well, our patient is awake, I see.
YOLANDA: Ulrich, how are you?
ULRICH: Uh…
SISSI: Oh, much, much better!\NI’ll take him to his room!
YOLANDA: Are you sure you’re all right?
JIM: What is this, an epidemic?
SISSI: Come on, hurry!
MILLY: Well, what do you know?
SISSI: See those three kids over there?
SISSI: They’re your worst enemies!
ULRICH: But why?
ODD: Hey, it’s Ulrich!
YUMI: What’s going on?\NWhy is he with Sissi?
ODD: You feeling better, good buddy?
ULRICH: Who are you, huh?\NLeave me alone, creep!
ODD: Come one, Ulrich, it’s me! Odd!
SISSI: That’s enough. Can’t you see?
SISSI: He doesn’t want to know you,\Nso stay away from us, understand?
ODD: What’s the matter with him?
SISSI: Ulrich, these are your good friends,\NNicholas and Herb.
HERB: Huh?
SISSI: He forgets things!\NYou’d better remind him!
ULRICH: I’m, um, very thirsty.
SISSI: You know what\Nwould be good for you?
SISSI: A walk in the park!
ULRICH: Here, thanks!
JEREMIE: He didn’t recognize us, it’s crazy!
JEREMIE: Could be amnesia…
YUMI: Let’s go see what the nurse says.
JEREMIE: Good idea.
ODD: I’ve gotta bring him back to his senses.
ODD: Sissi and Ulrich?\NCan you believe that?
SISSI: Here, you need the energy.
SISSI: Ulrich, what do you feel knowing\Nyou’re with the prettiest girl in school?
ULRICH: Well, to be honest, uh, nothing.
SISSI: What did you say?
ULRICH: What I mean is…\Nyou’re really not my type.
SISSI: Hmph.
ODD: Well, at least he’s not\Ncompletely out of his head yet.
ULRICH: Hm?
ULRICH: Hey, what are you doing? Spying on me!
ODD: Uh, no! I-I was just--
ULRICH: You’re a liar!
ODD: Ulrich, cut that out!
ODD: We’re buddies, remember?
ULRICH: That’s not what she says,\N so get out of here, and make it fast!
ODD: Okay, okay, don’t get all worked up!
SISSI: Ulrich? Are you alright? Come on!
ODD: Ulrich and Sissi. Just the two of you!
ODD: This could be\Nthe beginning of a big romance!
ULRICH: Ah, forget it!
ULRICH: She’s gonna be a\Npain in the neck the whole time!
SISSI: Come sit down, you need to rest.
ULRICH: I’m sorry, but…
ULRICH: What I need is to be alone.
YOLANDA: The answer is no!
YOLANDA: Can’t you see I have no time!
YOLANDA: I don’t know what’s happening,\Nbut it’s an epidemic!
YUMI: We can stay and help you if you want.
YOLANDA: The best way to help\Nis to stay out of my way!
YUMII: Maybe Odd had more luck.
ODD: No doubt about it,\NUlrich’s got amnesia.
ODD: I thought he was\Ngonna slug me just now!
YUMI: It’s a real epidemic\Naccording to the nurse.
JEREMIE: But you don’t just catch amnesia.\NIt’s not contagious.
JEREMIE: Something’s really weird.
YUMI: We’d better ask a doctor about it.
ODD: Too bad that nano doctors don’t exist yet.
JEREMIE: Nano doctor…
JEREMIE: now I understand!
ODD: Huh?
YUMI: Misses Hertz?
MRS. HERTZ: Oh, where am I?
YUMI: You’ll be alright.
JEREMIE: Look at this.
ODD: It’s the gelatin from this morning!
ODD: What are those ugly creatures?
JEREMIE: What I was afraid of.
JEREMIE: They’re nano viruses.
JEREMIE: And XANA must have created them\Nto attack memory cells.
YUMI: That means that it is contagious.
JEREMIE: Like all viruses, you can catch it\Nfrom food, contact, sneezing…
JEREMIE: Soon, the whole school\Nwill be infected, including us.
ODD: A world without memory…
YUMI: Under XANA’s control.
JEREMIE: Let’s go to the factory fast.
JEREMIE: Aelita must be in danger on Lyoko.
ODD: And Ulrich! We’re gonna need him!
YUMI: No, Odd, it’s Ulrich who needs our help.
YUMI: He’ll only get well if we\Ncan deactivate the tower.
JEREMIE: Yumi’s right.
JEREMIE: Besides, if he can’t remember anything,\Nhe won’t be much good to us.
ULRICH: E-Excuse me,\Ni-is my room around here?
STUDENT: Has everyone gone crazy around here?
STUDENT: Third door on the right.
ULRICH: Uh…
ULRICH: I don’t know who you are,\Nbut it seems we’re friends.
ULRICH: Hm…
DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)
YUMI: Not a minute to lose!
ULRICH: Huh? What’s going on around here?
MR. DELMAS: (GROANING)
ULRICH: Aah!
YUMI: Ulrich, I’m so glad you came.
YUMI: You really know how to\Ncheer someone up.
ODD: Yeah!
JEREMIE: Aelita!
AELITA: I haven’t seen anything to worry about
AELITA: either in the forest or in the desert area.
JEREMIE: Okay, beam yourself\Nover to the mountains.
JEREMIE: I’ll send Yumi and Odd to the glacier.
JEREMIE: The activated tower’s gotta be somewhere.
JEREMIE: Okay, ready for the north pole?
JEREMIE: We’re on our way, Aelita.
AELITA: Okay.
JEREMIE: We’re in the tunnel in the park.
JEREMIE: 10 seconds to transfer time.
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE: Transfer Yumi.
JEREMIE: Scanner Odd.
JEREMIE: Scanner Yumi.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
JEREMIE: Okay, take the access on your right!
ODD: Right, boss!
JEREMIE: Aelita, anything new?
AELITA: No.
AELITA: I haven’t been all over yet,\Nbut still no vibrations.
JEREMIE: Be careful.
JEREMIE: Yumi and Odd are pretty far away.
ULRICH: Ah…aaah!
ODD: Watch out!
JEREMIE: Yumi, you just lost 20 life points!
ODD: Jeremie, we’ve got a welcoming committee.
JEREMIE: Don’t panic, there’s just one Krab.
JEREMIE: But it means the\Nactivated tower can’t be far.
JEREMIE: I’ll warn Aelita.
JEREMIE: He’s coming towards you, Yumi!
YUMI: Don’t worry, he just wants to\Nplay hide-and-seek.
YUMI: Playful little beast.
ULRICH: Wow!
JEREMIE: Ulrich!
ULRICH: What am I doing here?\NWhat kind of place is this?
JEREMIE: I can’t tell you now,\Nwe’ve got an emergency.
ULRICH: Look, I can’t remember anything,
ULRICH: but I know I have\Nsomething important to do here.
ULRICH: Tell me what it is.
JEREMIE: Well, uh…sure, why not?
JEREMIE: Once you’re on Lyoko, you’ll have to\Ndo something, amnesia or not.
ULRICH: What’s Lyoko?
JEREMIE: It’s, uh…
JEREMIE: Look…see that pillar behind you?
JEREMIE: You’ve gotta slide up one level.
JEREMIE: You’ll see a few scanners.\NGet into one of them and just wait.
JEREMIE: You’ll get all the answers you want.
YUMI: Yoo-hoo!
YUMI: Over here!
YUMI: Hey, crabby!
: Hiyah!
JEREMIE: Target hit!
ODD: Nice going, Yumi!
JEREMIE: Two things, guys.
JEREMIE: One, Aelita’s waiting\Non the other side of the glacier.
ODD: And two?
JEREMIE: Two, Ulrich’s on the way.
ODD: Ulrich?
ODD: I’ll wait for him here.
YUMI: Better hurry!
JEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Scanner Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Virtualization!
ULRICH: Ouch!
ODD: Welcome to the virtual world, Ulrich!
ULRICH: What is this place?\NWhat are we here for?
ODD: To fight, of course.
ULRICH: To fight?
ULRICH: I don’t know how to fight!
ODD: But of course you do!
ODD: You just forgot, but I will refresh your memory.
ODD: Okay, come on!
YUMI: Hello, Aelita!
AELITA: I found the activated tower.\NWe’re almost there!
YUMI: Lead the way!
ULRICH: You’re just dodging my blows!\NDon’t you have a weapon?
ODD: I have a few arrows,\Nbut I’d rather save them for now.
ODD: And I don’t want to\Nhurt you with them, either.
ULRICH: Oh, yeah? No kidding.
AELITA: We’re almost there.
YUMI: Yeah, it seems almost too easy.\NI have a funny feeling about this.
YUMI: I’m sick of always being right.
YUMI: That way!
YUMI: Four against one.\NWell, it’s better than five or six.
JEREMIE: Hang in there, girls,\NI’ll try to send you reinforcements.
AELITA: First, let’s get rid of two of them.
DEFAULT: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
AELITA: Hurry! It’s not gonna hold for long!
ODD: Hey, you ought to save your strength.
ODD: You’re gonna need it.
ULRICH: Why, are there other levels?
ULRICH: I like it here! It’s a video game, but for real!
JEREMIE: Yeah, but now it’s time to stop.\NAelita and Yumi need you.
ULRICH: Huh? Who said that?
ODD: Jeremie. Come on!
ULRICH: Hey, wait! We haven’t finished the game!
JEREMIE: Again?
JEREMIE: Yumi, be careful.
JEREMIE: You’ve only got a few life points left.
JEREMIE: Nice going, Yumi.
YUMI: One to go!
AELITA: Hurry, Yumi! The wall’s not gonna last!
ULRICH: There! I win the game!
ODD: Yeah, but you beat an ally!
ULRICH: What?
ODD: Now that you know who your friends are,\Nit’s time to meet your enemies.
ULRICH: Huh? Enemies? What enemies?
ODD: They’re Krabs. Monsters created by XANA.
ODD: Listen, I can’t explain now.\NYumi and Aelita need our help.
: And right now.
ODD: To get rid of them,
ODD: you have to hit the thing\Non their shell that looks like an eye!
ULRICH: Sounds easy enough!
ODD: Laser arrow!
YUMI: Ulrich! Aah!
ULRICH: What happened to her?
ODD: Nothing serious.\NWe’ve gotta protect Aelita!
ULRICH: I’ll take care of it.
YUMI: It’s good to see Ulrich\N with his memory back again.
JEREMIE: You’re wrong, he’s still got amnesia!
YUMI: Hm?
ULRICH: Yaaah!
AELITA: Thanks for clearing the passage!
ULRICH: Huh? She’s leaving?
JEREMIE: Uh, not exactly total recall.
ULRICH: Jeremie, I’m coming!
ODD: No, I’m Odd!
ODD: Here we go!
DEFAULT: -Laser arrow!\N-Impact!
JEREMIE: Great, guys! You’re one heck of a team!
ULRICH: Is that it? No other players?
ODD: No, we can go home. The game’s over.
ULRICH: Huh? But how?
ODD: Magic. Watch.
JEREMIE: Return to the past now.
MRS. HERTZ: Exactly.

ULRICH: Let’s try to cook it! You never can tell!
MRS. HERTZ: Ulrich! What are you doing?
MRS. HERTZ: How dare you destroy school equipment!
MRS. HERTZ: I’ll have to punish you severely for that,
