AELITA: Aah!
AELITA: Say, Odd, why do you always
AELITA: have to wait for the last second?
ODD: Because it’s more fun, that’s why!
AELITA: Aah!
AELITA: Is that what you call fun?
AELITA: Looks more like\Ninsanity if you ask me.
ODD: Oh, really?
ODD: You mean there’s a difference?
ODD: Ha-ha-ha-ha!
ODD: Thanks, Yumi!
YUMI: Don’t mention it.
ULRICH: Hiya-a-a--ah!
JEREMIE: Odd and Aelita,\Nyou’re only a few minutes
JEREMIE: from the activated tower.
ODD: Bummer.
ODD: I was just starting to enjoy myself.
JEREMIE: Careful! Behind you!
AELITA: Wh--aah!
ODD: Well, at last, some action!
ODD: Sorry, Aelita!
ODD: We’re gonna have to jump!
AELITA: (SIGHS)
ODD: Hurry. I’ll cover you.
ODD: Laser arrow!
SCYPHOZOA: (SCREECHING)
YUMI: Hiyah!
JEREMIE: Good job, Yumi!
MUSIC: (SERENE MUSIC)
MUSIC: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
AELITA: All done, Jeremie.
AELITA: The tower’s been deactivated.
JEREMIE: Okay.
JEREMIE: I’ll start the return\Nand get you all home.
YUMI: Really? Why?
YUMI: XANA didn’t even have time\Nto launch an attack on earth.
JEREMIE: You can’t be too careful.
ULRICH: Uh, may I remind you that
ULRICH: going back in time\Nmakes XANA stronger?
JEREMIE: I know what I’m doing, alright?
ODD: Well, if you know,\Nthen explain it to us!
JEREMIE: Just trust me, okay?
AELITA: Jeremie.
AELITA: That’s not the point.
JEREMIE: That’s my final answer.
JEREMIE: Return to the past now.
DEFAULT: (WHIRRING DOWN)
ULRICH: Jeremie’s really becoming a pain.
ULRICH: He just flies off the handle\Nfor no reason at all.
ULRICH: He’s like a time bomb.
YUMI: Who knows.\NMaybe he’s got family problems.
ODD: Or else, he’s only just realized
ODD: he has a split personality\Nand that when the moon is full
ODD: he becomes the\Nson of Doctor Shrank!
ODD: Capable of grafting animal\Nbody parts onto human beings!
ODD: And he now knows\Nthat he must face up
ODD: to a fate worse than death.
ULRICH: You’ve been watching\NHorror at the Hospital again, huh?
ODD: How can anyone pass up\Nsuch a fantastic program?
ULRICH: Oh, there he is.
ODD: How’s life, Einstein?
AELITA: Where were you?
JEREMIE: In my room. Why?
JEREMIE: Is there a law against it?
YUMI: Chill, will you?\NWe were worried, that’s all.
JEREMIE: I’m a big boy now,\Nso just get off my back.
ULRICH: Hey, you might just\Nhave something there
ULRICH: with your Doctor Shrank theory.
ODD: Ah, you see? I told you so.
ODD: Right. In the meantime,
ODD: I’ve also got to face\Na fate worse than death.
ULRICH: What’s that?
ODD: Misses Meyer’s class.
MRS. MEYER: Thales' property allows us\Nto calculate length.
MRS. MEYER: For example, in a\Ntriangle marked A, B, C
MRS. MEYER: with straight lines called\NRS and BC, which are parallel.
MRS. MEYER: First, we calculate X.
MRS. MEYER: Then, SC.
MRS. MEYER: Hypothetically, ABC is a triangle.
MRS. MEYER: R is a point on AB.\NN is a point on AC.
DEFAULT: (SILENCE)
DEFAULT: (FOOTSTEPS ECHO)
MRS. MEYER: …equals seven times eight.
MRS. MEYER: 10𝔁 equals 56.
MRS. MEYER: And that’s it.
MRS. MEYER: It’s rather simple in the end.
JEREMIE: Mam.
MRS. MEYER: Uh, yes, Jeremie?
MRS. MEYER: Question?
JEREMIE: May I go to the infirmary?
MRS. MEYER: Oh. Yes, of course.
AELITA: Do you want me\Nto come with you?
JEREMIE: No.
DEFAULT: (STING)
YUMI: Jeremie skipped history class?
ULRICH: And gym class, too.
ULRICH: And now he’s skipping lunch.
ODD: Gym class and lunch\NI can understand,
ODD: But skipping history class\Nis not Jeremie’s style at all.
AELITA: I’m gonna check his room.
JEREMIE: Yes?
AELITA: It’s me.
AELITA: I brought your notes from the\Nclasses that you missed this morning.
JEREMIE: Put them down on the bed.
AELITA: Jeremie, if there’s anything wrong,
AELITA: you know you can\Ntalk to me about it, right?
JEREMIE: What’s up with you guys?
JEREMIE: There’s nothing wrong with me.\NI’m just working, that’s all.
JEREMIE: I’ve almost found the antivirus\Nwhich will free you from XANA.
JEREMIE: Isn’t that worth\Nspending some time on?
AELITA: Yes, of course, but…
AELITA: You’ve been acting strange recently.
AELITA: You should take a break\Nfrom time to time.
JEREMIE: Oh, yeah.
JEREMIE: Does XANA take breaks?\NNo.
JEREMIE: So, what do you want?
JEREMIE: You want him to\Nsteal your memory?
AELITA: I really don’t want\Nto lose you, Jeremie.
AELITA: And I can hardly\Nrecognize you anymore.
JEREMIE: Aelita.
JEREMIE: there’s something\NI have to tell you.
SFX: (BEEPING)
JEREMIE: Huh?
JEREMIE: You see!
JEREMIE: I told you XANA\Nnever takes a break.
YUMI: You sure you’re done now?
DEFAULT: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
JEREMIE: SOS XANA.
YUMI: Okay, Jeremie.\NWe’re on the way.
JEREMIE: Hurry up.
YUMI: XANA has launched an attack.
YUMI: We have to go to the factory.
ROSA: You over there!
ROSA: Sit back down!
ROSA: I said sit down!
ROSA: (GRUNTS)
ODD: I shouldn’t have said\Nher mashed potatoes
ODD: looked like barf, I guess.
YUMI: If you ask me, this looks\Nmore like a XANAfication.
YUMI: Cover me.
YUMI: I’ll try to reach Aelita\Nand Jeremie at the factory.
ODD: No problemo.
ODD: Ulrich, on three.
ODD: One, two…
ODD: three!
ROSA: Hey!
ODD: Ready for another round?
ODD: It’s not every day\Nwe get the opportunity
ODD: to break up the place!
JEREMIE: The activated tower\Nis in the mountain sector.
AELITA: Well, we’ll just have to\Nwait for the others.
JEREMIE: What on earth\Nare they doing?
YUMI: They’re doing what they can.
YUMI: XANA has possessed Rosa.
YUMI: We’ll have to make do\Nwithout them.
JEREMIE: Hurry up.
JEREMIE: I’ll start the virtualization process.
JEREMIE: Transfer Yumi.
JEREMIE: Transfer Aelita.
JEREMIE: Scanner Yumi.
JEREMIE: Scanner Aelita.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
JEREMIE: The activated tower should be\Nstraight ahead of you.
YUMI: We can see it, Jeremie.
YUMI: But there’s also an army\Nof monsters blocking our way.
YUMI: I have a funny feeling\Nwe should take cover.
YUMI: Come on.
JEREMIE: Yumi, Aelita, are you okay?
YUMI: We’d be a lot better if you\Ncould materialize the overwing.
JEREMIE: Okay. Coming up.
ODD: Jeremie,
ODD: How’s it going on your end?
ODD: 'Cause over here,\Nwe’re starting to run out of ammo.
ODD: Jeremie, you’d better hustle.
ODD: May I remind you that Rosa’s\Nspecialty is chopped sirloin?
JEREMIE: Come on, ladies!\NGet a move on!
JEREMIE: Odd and Ulrich are\Nin a really bad way.
YUMI: No kidding.\NAll we need here are
YUMI: some sandwiches\Nfor a nice picnic.
AELITA: We’ll never get through.
YUMI: Hold on a second.\NI’ve got a little idea.
AELITA: Little or big, it doesn’t matter\Nas long as it works.
ROSA: (GRUNTING)
ULRICH: Here she comes.
ULRICH: Now I know what Tweety\Nfeels like against Sylvester.
ODD: Jeremie, what are\Nyou guys waiting for?
JEREMIE: Aelita’s in the tower.
JEREMIE: Just hang in there\Nfor another 30 seconds.
ODD: 30 seconds!?
ODD: That’s like an eternity!
ODD: Jeremie, I think this calls for\Na return to the past, don’t you?
JEREMIE: Right. I’m launching it. Get ready.
JEREMIE: Return to the past now.
ULRICH: What’s he up to?
ULRICH: He should be here already.
AELITA: Why don’t we go check his room?
AELITA: Jeremie!
ODD: Jeremie, wake up! It’s terrible!
ODD: Aelita has fallen in love with Herb!
ODD: No reaction.
ODD: This is really serious.
YOLANDA: Right. I’m calling the hospital.
AELITA: Look!
AELITA: His eyelids are moving.
YOLANDA: He must be dreaming.
DEFAULT: (DEEP DRONE)
DEFAULT: (FOOTSTEPS ECHO)
JEREMIE: (PANTING)
ULRICH: What could’ve happened to him?
AELITA: Something must’ve happened\Nduring the last return to the past.
YUMI: XANA?
AELITA: I have no idea.
AELITA: But I think it’s worth\Nchecking out the supercomputer.
ODD: I’ll go with you.
YUMI: Should we search Jeremie’s room?
ULRICH: I really don’t want\Nto do that, but…
ULRICH: Nothing special.
ULRICH: Except that I just\Nfound out that Jeremie
ULRICH: still wears underwear\Nwith kangaroos on them.
ULRICH: I’ll have to tell him\Nto move on to boxers.
YUMI: No activated towers.
YUMI: But there’s a ton of files.
YUMI: Hey, I can’t open this one.
YUMI: It’s called, “My Journal.”
AELITA: The logs are all normal.
AELITA: There certainly was a\Nmajor discharge of energy
AELITA: during that last\Nreturn to the past, though.
AELITA: But they’re no different from\Nany of the previous returns to the past.
AELITA: Ulrich?
ULRICH: We need you.
ULRICH: Can you meet us\Nin Jeremie’s room?
AELITA: Okay.
AELITA: There. And I…
AELITA: Got it.
AELITA: It wasn’t easy, but I got it.
AELITA: These are video files.
YUMI: Just open the first one.
JEREMIE: Today, I have decided\Nto start a video journal.
JEREMIE: A bit like the diary\Nthat Franz Hopper kept.
JEREMIE: This way, if anything\Nhappens to me,
JEREMIE: others might be able\Nto continue my research.
JEREMIE: My search to\Nfind the antivirus
JEREMIE: which will free\NAelita from XANA
JEREMIE: has never been\Ncloser to total success.
JEREMIE: And it’s thanks to\NFranz Hopper’s diary
JEREMIE: and thanks to the data\Nrecovered from sector five
JEREMIE: that I was able to\Ndecode part of his diary
JEREMIE: that explains how to\Nuse the returns to the past
JEREMIE: to logarithmically\Nincrease your intelligence.
JEREMIE: I immediately tried it.
JEREMIE: It’s amazing.
JEREMIE: It’s as if my brain suddenly\Nhad the processing power
JEREMIE: of 10 computers linked in series.
AELITA: A neuronal headset.
YUMI: Open the most recent entry.
AELITA: This one’s from yesterday.
JEREMIE: Every time I use the headset,
JEREMIE: my mental and physical health\Ngets worse and worse.
JEREMIE: But I’m moving so far\Nforward in my research.
JEREMIE: I can’t stop\Nthis close to success.
ULRICH: That’s all we needed.
AELITA: Is there anything\Nwe can do to save him?
ODD: Let’s go to the factory.
YUMI: I’ll meet you there.
YUMI: First, I have to\Nstop by the infirmary.
YUMI: I want to make sure\Nthat XANA’s attack
YUMI: isn’t directed at Jeremie.
MR. DELMAS: Come with me.\NThere are papers we have to sign.
DEFAULT: (SINISTER MUSIC)
DEFAULT: Hey! My ambulance!
YUMI: Is Jeremie in there?
YOLANDA: Yes, but he isn’t driving it.
YUMI: (PANTING)
YUMI: Aelita, XANA has taken\Ncontrol of Jeremie’s ambulance.
YUMI: I’m gonna try\Nto do something,
YUMI: but I’m really\Ncounting on you guys.
AELITA: Okay.
AELITA: We’ll go as fast\Nas we can, I promise.
AELITA: Odd, Ulrich,\Nare you in position?
ODD: Ready.
ULRICH: Ready.
AELITA: Virtualization in 30 seconds.
AELITA: I’ll be right there.
AELITA: The tower is that way.
AELITA: Sorry, I couldn’t\Nmaterialize the vehicles.
AELITA: We’ll have to go on foot.
YUMI: Jeremie!
JEREMIE: (PANTING)
YUMI: Jeremie!
YUMI: Jeremie, wake up!
YUMI: Jeremie!
YUMI: Jeremie!
YUMI: It’s me, Yumi!
YUMI: Wake up!
YUMI: Wake up!
YUMI: Jeremie! Jeremie…
JEREMIE: Yumi, what’s going on?
YUMI: Just…huge problems.
YUMI: Same old routine.
YUMI: Before we can do anything else,\Nwe have to get out of here.
JEREMIE: Hey, don’t you think we ought\Nto stop the ambulance first?
YUMI: Well, of course I do,\Nbut do you mind telling me how?
YUMI: Make it fast because we are heading\Nstraight for the river.
JEREMIE: Huh?!
AELITA: There!
AELITA: (GASPS)
TARANTULA: (SCREECHING)
ODD: Maybe you shouldn’t have\Nsaid it so loud.
ULRICH: I’ve got an idea.
ODD: I love it when you say that.
ODD: Laser arrow!
DEFAULT: (SCREECHING)
YUMI: (GRUNTS)
YUMI: Hurry!
YUMI: Oh, darn it!
YUMI: Oh, no!
YUMI: Help had better be\Non the way, like, now.
ODD: You got any other\Nbrilliant ideas, Ulrich?
ULRICH: Uh…well…
ULRICH: Aah!
ODD: Man, that was not cool.
AELITA: Odd, watch it!
YUMI: Ulrich! Odd! Aelita,\Nare you there?
YUMI: Ulrich!
ULRICH: Yumi, are you okay?
YUMI: To tell the truth, uh, no.
ODD: Now the problem is\Nhow to reach the tower.
ULRICH: Yeah. And fast.
ULRICH: Yumi and Jeremie\Nhave gone for a dip
ULRICH: in an ambulance at\Nthe bottom of the river.
ODD: Just a little tarantula\Nto get rid of first.
ODD: Shield!
AELITA: Odd, leave it to me.
ODD: Nice one.
AELITA: (GASPS)
AELITA: Aah!
ULRICH: Yumi, we got it.
ULRICH: Aelita has deactivated the tower.
YUMI: Super. Now we can\Ndrown in peace.
YUMI: Ulrich, we’re still at\Nthe bottom of the river.
YUMI: The only thing that\Ncan save us now
YUMI: is a return to the past.
ULRICH: But I have no idea\Nhow to do that.
JEREMIE: Put me on.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, I need you to do\Nexactly what I say, okay?
ULRICH: Yeah. Right. Uh-huh.
ULRICH: Y-Yes--wait, wait!
ULRICH: N-Not so fast!
ULRICH: Where’s the button?\NI-I don’t see it.
YUMI: Quickly!
JEREMIE: On the right.
JEREMIE: On the upper right\Nof the keyboard!
JEREMIE: The jump button\Nin Ultimate Blaster!
ULRICH: Uh, okay. I got it.
ULRICH: Return to the past now.
ULRICH: Don’t tell me he’s\Nout cold again.
AELITA: Jeremie, no!
JEREMIE: I’ve checked the calculations\NI’ve done over the past few weeks.
JEREMIE: Most of them are wrong.
ODD: So, you were\Ndestroying your health
ODD: without even improving\Nyour brain power.
ODD: I wouldn’t call that a\Nvery good deal.
YUMI: Do you think that XANA\Nhad something to do with it?
JEREMIE: He certainly\Nput me on the trap,
JEREMIE: but the information did come\Nfrom Franz Hopper’s diary.
ULRICH: In some way, then, we have\Nnot just one, but two enemies.
JEREMIE: Hopper is certainly\Nnot an enemy,
JEREMIE: but his discoveries\Nare out of our league.
JEREMIE: I think we’d better be careful.
AELITA: For now, the important thing is
AELITA: that you get back to\Nbeing your old self again.
ODD: That’s for sure.
ODD: Seeing you so grouchy,
ODD: you were getting to\Nbe like Doctor Shrank,
ODD: or even worse.
ODD: Huh, Ulrich?
ULRICH: Hey! I am not…
ULRICH: …grouchy.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
JEREMIE: Yeah, right!\NGimme a break!
ULRICH: Well, alright.
