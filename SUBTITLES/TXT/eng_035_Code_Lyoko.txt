ULRICH: Hey, everybody.
JEREMIE: Wow, that's a tough break.
ODD: You've got to be kidding!
YUMI: Unfortunately, I'm not.
ULRICH: Hey, uh, what's going on here?
AELITA: I wish I could do something, Yumi.
YUMI: That's really nice of you, Aelita.
ULRICH: But…
ULRICH: would somebody tell me what's going on?
JEREMIE: Look, we'll talk about it after class, okay?
DEFAULT: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
ULRICH: Don’t mind me!
ULRICH: Keep making like I don’t exist. Okay?
ULRICH: Say that again.
ODD: Yumi's father lost his job.
ODD: They're thinking of going back to Japan so he can find work.
ULRICH: You've got to be kidding!
JEREMIE: It's not for sure yet, so don't panic.
ULRICH: What?
ULRICH: Yumi's leaving, we may never see her again,\Nand I shouldn't panic?
ODD: You know what?
ODD: There is an easy solution.
ULRICH: Oh yeah? What?
ODD: Well uh, you see, if you marry Yumi,\Nthen she can get a greencard!
ULRICH: Very funny.
ODD: I’m just trying to lighten things up.
ULRICH: Por favor, senor Cadja
TEACHER: Si Ulrich?
ULRICH: Can I please go to the infirmary?\NI’m not feeling too well.
TEACHER: In Moby Dick,
ULRICH: Melville uses the literary technique\Nof a character in the novel speaking-
YUMI: Excuse me ma’am?
TEACHER: Yes, Yumi?
YUMI: Could I please go to the infirmary?
ULRICH: Why can’t you stay at the school as a boarder?
ULRICH: And you could go to Japan during summer vacation.
YUMI: Are you kidding?
YUMI: My parents would never go for that.
YUMI: And what’s more, they need me.
ULRICH: Isn’t it supposed to be the\Nother way around?
ULRICH: What if-?
YUMI: Ulrich, it’s nice of you\Nto try find a solution,
YUMI: but nothing has been settled.
YUMI: There might not be anything\Nto worry about.
ULRICH: I know!
ULRICH: Why don’t we write to a\Ncongressmen and ask for help?
YUMI: Sure, why not the\Npresident while you’re at it!
ODD: Are you ready for dinner?
ULRICH: You go on, I’ll see you there.
ULRICH: Dear Mr. President.
ULRICH: I’m writing to you about a\Nyoung girl named Yumi.
ULRICH: Yumi is an amazing person.
ULRICH: She’s originally from Japan,\Nbut she really likes her country.
ULRICH: Uhh, what a load of garbage.
ULRICH: Dear Mr. President...
ULRICH: Will you be quiet?\NCan’t you see I’m trying to concentrate?

RADIO: And now that big bonus number, 14.
RADIO: Two times lucky seven, 14.\NAnyway…
RADIO: ...remember folks this weeks super jackpot\Nis 30 million big ones!
ULRICH: No, I couldn’t do that…\NIt wouldn’t be right.
MS. ISHIYAMA: Did you go back to\Nsee the temp agencies?
MR. ISHIYAMA: I haven’t had time.
MS. ISHIYAMA: Too bad, they might’ve\Nhad something for you.
MS. ISHIYAMA: I mean, to tide us over\Nuntil we return to Kyoto.
MR. ISHIYAMA: There is nothing\Nout there for me,
MR. ISHIYAMA: There are too many people in my field.\NYou know that very well.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Anyway, if you don’t look, you certainly won’t find anything.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Oh, will you stop it now? What about you?\NDid you go to the temp agencies today?
MR. ISHIYAMA: Hmm?
KIWI: (BARKS)
ODD: He’s not in our room. I don’t know where he is.
AELITA: I get the feeling that Ulrich is taking\Nthis situation even harder than we are.
ODD: You can say that again.\NFor Ulrich, losing Yumi is…
ODD: Well, imagine how you’d\Nfeel if Jeremie had to leave.
AELITA: Why do you say that?
ODD: ‘Cause I love making you blush.
AELITA: Wait, what just happened?\NWhy did we return to the past?
YUMI: Could XANA have taken control of the back-in-time function?\NHe’s done it before.
JEREMIE: No way. I made a special program\Nso he couldn’t.
JEREMIE: The superscan doesn’t show any active towers.\NThis is really weird.
JEREMIE: I’ll go to the factory after class and check it out.
ULRICH: Here you go.
DEFAULT: Uh, you do know that you’re not\Nreally old enough to play, young man?
ULRICH: Oh, it’s for my mom.\NShe asked me to buy it for her.
DEFAULT: Ah, well in that case...
JEREMIE: Ulrich, we’re gonna check out things\Nat the factory after class.
JEREMIE: About the jump back in time.\NYou coming?
ULRICH: No, I, uh… I have to, uh, study for chemistry.
ODD: Hey, mind if I study with you?\NI don’t get Mendeleev’s Periodic Table at all.
ULRICH: I’d rather study by myself.
ODD: Huh?
ULRICH: Well, I know you’re gonna think this is ridiculous.
ULRICH: But I heard you had some problems with work and everything.\NAnd I thought, well…
ULRICH: I bought you a lotto ticket!\NYou never know, maybe you’ll be lucky.
ULRICH: Then you could stay here, with Yumi.
MR. ISHIYAMA: (LAUGHS)\NI’m sorry, son, but you have to admit that it is very funny.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Do you know the odds of winning the lotto?
MR. ISHIYAMA: Heh, at least you made me laugh.\NThat’s something I need right now.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Anyway, it was very nice of you, Ulrich,\Nwe’re really touched.
ULRICH: Don’t forget to listen for the numbers!
ULRICH: Oh, and please don’t tell Yumi\Nthat I gave it to you! She might take it the wrong way.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: That Ulrich is such a sweetheart.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Yes, only he doesn’t realize that we have\None chance in fourteen million of ever winning.
DEFAULT: Now, once again, today’s lotto results!
DEFAULT: The winning numbers for today’s\Nsuper jackpot drawing are...
DEFAULT: 6, 22, 10, 47, 13, 37
DEFAULT: and the bonus number is… 14!
MR. ISHIYAMA: I can’t believe it…
YUMI: Hey there, what’s going on?
MRS. ISHIYAMA: This is the winning ticket… the jackpot!
HIROKI: What’s a jackpot?
MR. ISHIYAMA: It’s incredible!
YUMI: You played the lotto? But I thought you hated gambling.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Actually, it was your friend Ulrich who played,\Nand he gave us the ticket.
MR. ISHIYAMA: He didn’t want you to know.
JEREMIE: I don’t get it. XANA had nothing to do with it.
JEREMIE: It’s as if someone had\Nset off the return to the past from here.
JEREMIE: Except that I’m the only one that knows how to do it.
AELITA: Unless… someone read your manual.
JEREMIE: What makes you say that?
ULRICH: Hi.
JEREMIE: Hi, Ulrich. You know, I’m really impressed\Nwith your computer skills.
ULRICH: Who, me? You are?
JEREMIE: Well, you did enter the code for returning to the past into the computer\Nwithout making a single mistake, well done.
ULRICH: What are you talking about?
YUMI: Don’t waste your breath. We know it was you who set off the return to the past.
ODD: You broke rule number one, Ulrich, I can’t believe it.
ULRICH: I only did it for Yumi, so you could stay.
YUMI: I didn’t ask for your help.
JEREMIE: Do you realize what you’ve done, Ulrich?
JEREMIE: You know that going back\Nin time makes XANA stronger!
ODD: Why didn’t you talk to us first, huh?\NWhy did you have to go sneaking around?
ULRICH: I’m sorry…
JEREMIE: It’s too late for sorry. You betrayed our trust.
YUMI: Here. You can take back your dumb ticket.
YUMI: My parents think you should keep the money.
JEREMIE: As of now, and until you hear otherwise,\Nyou’re out of the group, Ulrich.
AELITA: I hope this will all work out.
SISSI: Hey, what’s up, Ulrich?\NYou don’t look too good.
ULRICH: You’re right. And when I see you, it gets even worse.
SISSI: That’ll teach me to be nice to people.
ULRICH: Sissi, wait.
ULRICH: I apologize.
ULRICH: I’m just a little edgy.
HERB: I really don’t understand what she sees in him.
NICOLAS: You said it. He sure is no match for my looks or my brains.
HERB: Hmph. You think you’re handsome, huh?
NICOLAS: No more than you think you’re smart.
HERB: I dare you to say that again!
TEACHER: Africa is the continent that suffers most\Nfrom problems related to a shortage of water
TEACHER: and rural areas of Africa\Nare affected to an even greater extent.
TEACHER: Less than half of all rural zones\Nhave any access to--
ODD: Wow, when I think how much\Nwe complain all the time…
JEREMIE: XANA has launched an attack.
AELITA: What?
JEREMIE: We have less than a minute left of class. We’ll go to the factory as soon as the bell rings.
ODD: Without Ulrich?
JEREMIE: Without Ulrich.
TEACHER: See you next week, then.
HERB: Hey, Nicolas!
TEACHER: And don’t forget your project reports\Non your own ideas for helping African communities.

JEREMIE: Virtualization!
JEREMIE: Here come your vehicles.
ODD: Madame, would you do me the honor\Nof climbing aboard my humble… board?
AELITA: (GIGGLES)
JEREMIE: The activated tower is located two plateaus north.
YUMI: Okay, let’s go.
ODD: Yeah!
JEREMIE: No monsters on the horizon for the time being.
YUMI: It’s not monsters I’m worried about.\NIt’s XANA attack on Earth.
YUMI: We still don’t know what he’s got in store for us this time.
JEREMIE: Yeah, well, I’d rather we deactivated\Nthe tower before we find out.
JEREMIE: Aah!
NICOLAS: At your orders, XANA.
AELITA: Look! Over there, a Krab!
YUMI: Are my eyes playing tricks on me,\Nor are there at least twenty of them?
AELITA: Yumi, there are no mirages on Lyoko.
YUMI: That’s what I was afraid of.
ODD: By the way, thanks for warning us, Jeremie!
ODD: Jeremie?
NICOLAS: Now your wounds will become fatal!
NICOLAS: (LAUGHS)
YUMI: Jeremie, was that you?
YUMI: Answer me, will you?
ODD: That isn’t Jeremie, I’d recognize that laugh anywhere.\NIt’s Nicolas.
YUMI: Nicolas? Are you sure?
ODD: Nobody else has a laugh that dumb.\NNo one in the whole universe!
AELITA: Watch out, the Krabs!
ODD: We better get out of here, fast!
ODD: Yumi!
ODD: Yumi, are you okay?
YUMI: I don’t understand, why does it hurt so much? Shouldn’t I just lose some life points?
ODD: Something’s wrong at the factory.
AELITA: Odd, the Krabs.\NWe’re gonna have to take cover.
SISSI: You’re even more handsome when you train.
ULRICH: Sissi, I think I’d rather be alone.
SISSI: Are you crazy?\NThat’s the last thing you need when you’re feeling down.
SISSI: It’s just the opposite, you need your friends to be there.
ULRICH: Uh-uh. I don’t have friends anymore.
SISSI: What about me?\NWhat does that make me, then?
HERB: Sissi, there you are!\NI’ve been looking all over for you!
SISSI: Yeah? Well, pretend I’m not here\Nand keep on looking.
SISSI: Why don’t you go out and play\Nwith your friend Nicolas?
HERB: I would, but I can’t find Nicolas, either.
HERB: He ran off like a madman after class\Nto follow Jeremie, Odd, and the new girl.
HERB: He was really spaced out.
HERB: His voice sounded weird\Nand there was something strange about his eyes.
ULRICH: XANA.
SISSI: Why are you telling me all this?\NI don’t care. Can’t you see I’m with Ulrich?
HERB: Well, not anymore, you’re not.
SISSI: Huh?
ODD: I’ll go and check it out.
ODD: We’d better move. Otherwise--
ODD: Wow, that really does hurt.
AELITA: My turn.
AELITA: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
AELITA: It won’t take them long to find a way around.
ULRICH: Jeremie?
NICOLAS: Maybe I know what you’re looking for!
ULRICH: Wow, since when have you become an athlete?\NI don’t believe it.
ULRICH: Come on, Spiderman.\NHold on, I’m not out yet.
DEFAULT: (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
ULRICH: Jeremie, wake up, will you?\NYou gotta get up!
JEREMIE: Hey… hi, Ulrich, how are you?
ULRICH: Jeremie, pull yourself together,\NI need your help.
JEREMIE: ...because I’m not feeling so great.
ULRICH: Odd, Yumi, Aelita, can you hear me?\NAnswer me, will ya?
YUMI: Ulrich, is that you?
ULRICH: Oh great, you’re alive.
ODD: Yeah, but not in great shape.
AELITA: What about Jeremie?
ULRICH: He’s also in pretty bad shape.
ULRICH: I don’t get it, there’s nothing on the screens.
YUMI: That must be why the fire\Nfrom XANA’s monsters hurt us for real!
ODD: What was that noise?
AELITA: It’s just what I was afraid of.
AELITA: The Krabs have broken through the sand wall!
ULRICH: I’m really sorry about this, Jeremie,\Nbut it’s for a good cause.
JEREMIE: Ouch! What--\Nwhat’s going on?
ODD: Okay, this is no time to drag your feet.
JEREMIE: Nicolas has deactivated the scanner.\NI should be able to fix it pretty fast.
ULRICH: Jeremie, I, uh, wanted to tell you--

YUMI: Just a little, yeah.
ODD: Yeah, but those guys aren't gonna\Nkeep missing us if we stick around.
JEREMIE: Your vehicles are on the way.\NThey could come in handy.
ODD: Okay, great. Now all we have to do\Nis cross that line of monsters.
ODD: You and Yumi may as well go over the top.
YUMI: And what about you?
ODD: I’ll do what I do best.\NChef’s surprise.

YOLANDA: Nothing serious, in any case.
YUMI: I know you did it for me, Ulrich.
ULRICH: But I should’ve asked you first.
YUMI: Right.
ULRICH: I’m sorry.
AELITA: So, are you back in the group?
ULRICH: Hmm, looks like it.
ODD: Hey, what are you gonna do\Nwith that lotto ticket?
ULRICH: I thought about it, and I decided to give it\Nto an association that builds wells in Africa.
YUMI: Really?\NOh, that’s a great idea!
DEFAULT: (PHONE RINGS)
DEFAULT: Yes?
DEFAULT: Yeah, Mom, I’m listening.\NUh-huh. Uh-huh. Alright, see you tonight.
