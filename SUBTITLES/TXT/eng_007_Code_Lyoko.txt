JEREMIE: 30 degrees north.
JEREMIE: You should be able\Nto see it by now.
YUMI: No kidding.
YUMI: Sticks out like a sore thumb.
YUMI: There’s nothing happening.
YUMI: It’s awfully calm.
JEREMIE: Well, be careful.\NYou never know.
AELITA: Yoo-hoo!
AELITA: Hi, Jeremie.
AELITA: I don’t see anything\Nout of the ordinary in the tower.
AELITA: Are you sure\Nit’s the right one?
JEREMIE: That was what the scan picked up.
JEREMIE: At least for a few seconds.
JEREMIE: And you said you felt pulsations\Na while ago, didn’t you?
AELITA: I did.
AELITA: Well, let’s say yes and no.
AELITA: I’m not sure I did anymore.\NI thought I did.
JEREMIE: Okay, then.
JEREMIE: (SCREAMING)
AELITA: Sounds like Yumi!
JEREMIE: What’s going on?
JEREMIE: Can you hear me, Yumi?
JEREMIE: Answer me!
JEREMIE: Yumi?
AELITA: Jeremie, Yumi’s disappeared.
JEREMIE: What? Come on, she\Ncouldn’t have just vanished.
JEREMIE: Aelita, hold on.\NI’ll get back to you.
AELITA: Jeremie? Jeremie!
JEREMIE: Hey, Yumi!
JEREMIE: Yumi?
ODD: Hey, what’s wrong\Nwith the hot chocolate today?
ODD: It tastes like dirty sweat socks\Nand an old pair of sneakers!
ULRICH: Odd the gourmet.
SISSI: Yoo-hoo!
SISSI: Hey, Ulrich!
SISSI: Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!
ODD: Well, what do you know.\NYour fan club.
SISSI: I don’t believe it!
SISSI: Your darling Yumi has\Ndeserted you for once?
ODD: Like your brain, huh?
ODD: It deserted you\Na long time ago.
ULRICH: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
ULRICH: Hello? Oh, it’s you, Jeremie.
ODD: I recommend the hot chocolate.
ODD: Take my word for it.
ULRICH: Mhmm? What?
JEREMIE: Okay, easy does it. That’s it.
YOLANDA: Well, then.\NWhat happened to her?
JEREMIE: Well, she started\Nfeeling sick…during recess.
ODD: It’s because she’s\Nbeen studying real hard.
ODD: Our teachers give us\Nway too much homework!
YOLANDA: Alright. I’ll take care of her.
YOLANDA: Now, back to class, all of you.
YOLANDA: You heard what I said.\NNow, go. Go on.
YOLANDA: Well, feeling better, hm?
YOLANDA: Hey!
YOLANDA: No, no, no. Come on.\NLie down now, you hear?
YOLANDA: Please, you need to rest!
ULRICH: Are you sure she\Nwasn’t hit by a laser?
ULRICH: Maybe there was a megatank\Nhiding somewhere.
JEREMIE: No, no.\NI would’ve seen it on the screen.
JEREMIE: She still had all her life points\Nwhen she was devirtualized.
ULRICH: Well, in any case,\Nsomething abnormal happened.
JEREMIE: Yeah, that’s for sure.
JEREMIE: The proof is she passed out\Nin the scanner.
JEREMIE: Normally,\Nthe return trip’s pretty easy.
ODD: Huh, that’s what you think.
ODD: You ought to try it\None of these days.
ODD: You’ll love it!
ULRICH: Oh, Yumi!
ODD: Guess you’re feeling better, huh?
ULRICH: You had us scared.
JEREMIE: Tell us what happened.
ULRICH: You sure you’re okay?
YUMI: Yeah, I’m just tired.
JEREMIE: Yumi, tell us what\Nhappened on Lyoko.
YUMI: Nothing, you hear?
YUMI: Come on, let’s go\Nover to the factory now.
ULRICH: In your condition?\NThat’s a pretty crazy idea.
ODD: Hey, listen, we’ve got\Nmore important things to do.
ODD: Like eating.
ODD: For example.
ODD: Hey…
ULRICH: What about Aelita?\NIs she safe?
JEREMIE: Yeah, I hope so.
JEREMIE: I told her to stay in the tower.
AELITA: I’ve got to go and check it out.
JEREMIE: And you really can’t\Nremember what happened?
YUMI: No, nothing.
ULRICH: Do you think it could’ve\Ncome from the scanners?
ULRICH: A bug or something like that?
ODD: Unless it’s XANA trying out\Na new way of attacking.
JEREMIE: I haven’t the slightest idea.
JEREMIE: I’m wondering\Nif all these transfers
JEREMIE: aren’t becoming\Na health problem.
ODD: Hey, do I smell fish,\Nor just cheap perfume?
SISSI: You’re such a riot.
SISSI: Ulrich…
SISSI: what do you say we\Nget together after school, huh?
ULRICH: Get together with you?
ULRICH: Very tempting, but, uh, not.
SISSI: You’re showing off\Nbecause Yumi’s here, huh?
SISSI: Mademoiselle likes to keep\Nthe competition as far away as she can.
YUMI: That’s not true.
YUMI: Why don’t you go out with her?
YUMI: She’s really pretty.
SISSI: Hey, you wouldn’t be trying\Nto make fun of me, would you?
SISSI: No? Hah, great!\NThanks a lot, Yumi!
SISSI: Ulrich…
SISSI: I’ll be waiting for you\Nin the park after school! Ciao!
ULRICH: Hey, what are you\Ntrying to pull anyway, huh?
YUMI: Nothing. Go on, go out with her.
YUMI: She’s been waiting\Nfor this for ages. Go on.
MR. DELMAS: Miss Ishiyama.\NCome to my office right now.
AELITA: But that thing wasn’t there before…
AELITA: It looks like a guardian.
ULRICH: What’s going on with Yumi?
ULRICH: Is she mad at me or what?\NI’ve never seen her like that.
JEREMIE: She must’ve had\Na really serious shock.
HERB: Ulrich!
HERB: What’s the big idea of\Nhaving a date with Sissi, huh!
JEREMIE: This isn’t the time for that\Nyou hear, Herb?
JEREMIE: If you want an explanation,\Ngo and ask Sissi.
JEREMIE: Okay, I’ll leave you to\Nyour love stories.
JEREMIE: I’ve got a super-psychopathic\Ncomputer to feed.
MR. DELMAS: Yumi, this is unspeakable.
MR. DELMAS: Our poor Nurse Dorothy\Nis still very upset.
MR. DELMAS: How could you have\Ndone such a thing?
MR. DELMAS: I’m giving you two hours\Nof detention in the library
MR. DELMAS: to teach you a lesson.
MR. DELMAS: Well, go on.
MR. DELMAS: There’s something\Ntroubling you, Yumi.
MR. DELMAS: Care to tell me about it?
MR. DELMAS: Yumi, I’m here to help you--\Nthat’s part of my job.
MR. DELMAS: Very well.
MR. DELMAS: Keep this up and I’ll have to\Ninform your parents
MR. DELMAS: about the way you’re behaving.
YUMI: Not my parents.
MR. DELMAS: That’s enough now, Miss Ishiyama.
MR. DELMAS: What! But…
MR. DELMAS: Get your hand\Noff the phone right now!
YUMI: Not my parents!
MR. DELMAS: I won’t warn you again.
MR. DELMAS: Yumi, if you keep this up\NI’ll suspend you!
YUMI: No!
JIM: Hello there, Yumi!
AELITA: As soon as I got\Nclose to the monsters,
AELITA: they started to shoot.
JEREMIE: You shouldn’t have\Nleft the tower, Aelita.
AELITA: I know.
AELITA: You’re not too\Nmad at me, are you?
JEREMIE: Mad? No.
JEREMIE: Besides, I think you made\Nan important discovery.
JEREMIE: This could have something to do\Nwith what happened to Yumi.
AELITA: Should I go back there?
JEREMIE: No, hold on.
JEREMIE: I’ll send Ulrich and Odd as backup.
AELITA: Jeremie, what happened to Yumi
AELITA: might happen to one of\Nyour friends or both of them.
AELITA: If they came to Lyoko now,\Nit could be very dangerous for them.
JEREMIE: I guess you’re right.
JEREMIE: Go on, then, but promise me\Nyou’ll be careful.
AELITA: You know me.
JEREMIE: Oh, it’s you.
JEREMIE: What did the principal want?
YUMI: We have to go to the factory now.
JEREMIE: Oh, no. Forget it.
JEREMIE: First of all, there’s no reason to go.
JEREMIE: And second, you have to rest.
YUMI: I have to go to the scanner room.
JEREMIE: No.
JEREMIE: Nobody’s going back to Lyoko\Nuntil I give the order.
JEREMIE: It’s too dangerous.
JEREMIE: I’ve got some tests I have to run first.
YUMI: Hey…
: it’s important, you hear?
YUMI: I have to go back\Nto the scanner room.
JEREMIE: Er…Yumi, what are you trying to…
YUMI: Shh.
YUMI: There.
JEREMIE: I, uh…
JEREMIE: I’m not sure it’s a good idea--
JEREMIE: you should go home\Nand get some rest!
YUMI: Come on, take me\Nto the scanner room.
JEREMIE: Uh b-b-b-b-but
JEREMIE: you should go home\Nand take a bath!
JEREMIE: No, a cold shower!\NVery cold!
JEREMIE: Very, very, very cold\Nto calm you down!
ULRICH: Jeremie, hurry up,\Nwe’ve got to get going--
JEREMIE: Ulrich, no wait!\NIt’s not what you think!
JEREMIE: I swear, Ulrich, wait!
ODD: Bravo.
AELITA: Okay, time to go.
MRS. HERTZ: And we can also observe\Ncases of parthenogenesis
MRS. HERTZ: among certain insects.
MRS. HERTZ: This phenomenon\Nis relatively common
MRS. HERTZ: and comparable to\Na sort of natural cloning.
MRS. HERTZ: That is to say the animal\Ngives birth to a replica of itself--
MRS. HERTZ: an exact replica with\Nno differences between them.
MRS. HERTZ: Scientists have succeeded\Nin employing this process with rabbits.
MRS. HERTZ: Alright, we’ll continue\Nwith this subject tomorrow.
DEFAULT: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
JEREMIE: Ulrich, you have to listen.
ULRICH: I don’t want to listen to you.
JEREMIE: Something’s not right with Yumi.
JEREMIE: She’s not in her normal state.
JEREMIE: I don’t know what she’s been through,
JEREMIE: but she’s traumatized.
ULRICH: Okay. Let’s go.
AELITA: Oh, no.
ULRICH: What do you think\Nthis phenomenon is?
JEREMIE: I wish I could tell you,\Nbut I have no idea.
JEREMIE: Aelita’s checking it out.
JEREMIE: It could be XANA’s doing.
JEREMIE: I forgot to lock the door.
JEREMIE: All my equipment!
ULRICH: You think Sissi’s behind all this?
JEREMIE: Why would she want to do it?
ODD: Hey, maybe it’s Herb.
ODD: He sure was mad\Nwhen we saw him today.
JEREMIE: Wait, who was the last one\Nto leave this room?
ULRICH: Oh, no.
ULRICH: No, that’s impossible. Not Yumi.
ODD: You’ve got to admit\Nshe’s been acting weird lately.
ULRICH: Okay.
ULRICH: Yumi hasn’t been\Nherself lately, that’s right,
: but still, the enemy is XANA.
ULRICH: Jeremie’s right.\NXANA’s launched an attack.
: and I’m sure all this other stuff\Nis to distract us
ULRICH: while he’s calmly and quietly\Ngetting rid of Aelita.
JEREMIE: Aelita!
JEREMIE: She’s all alone on Lyoko,\Nand we can’t get to her!
YUMI: Are we going to\Nthe scanner room?
JEREMIE: Yeah, let’s go.
ODD: Go on, do your stuff, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Are you ready?\NHere we go.
JEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE: Transfer Yumi.
JEREMIE: Scanner Odd.
JEREMIE: Scanner Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Scanner Yumi.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
ULRICH: Where’s Yumi?
JEREMIE: What? She’s not with you?
ULRICH: No, she wasn’t transferred.
ODD: Over there!
ODD: Laser arrow!
AELITA: Hurry, we’ve got to go and free Yumi.
ULRICH: Yumi? Yumi’s not…
AELITA: The real Yumi.
AELITA: The one who’s here on Lyoko.
AELITA: The other one was created by XANA.
AELITA: Jeremie, whatever you do,\Ndon’t go anywhere near Yumi.
AELITA: Do you hear me, Jeremie?
AELITA: Jeremie!
JEREMIE: Yumi!
JEREMIE: What are you doing!
ULRICH: Now!
ODD: Laser arrow!
YUMI: (CACKLES)
ULRICH: Y-a-a-a-a-h!
AELITA: It’s a guardian.
AELITA: A sort of digital jail adapted\Nto the body imprisoned in it.
ULRICH: I can’t destroy it with my weapons.
AELITA: I can create a clone--\Na false image of Yumi.
AELITA: We can try to convince\Nthe guardian that he’s mistaken.
ULRICH: Okay, let’s go.
SFX: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
ODD: Oh, wow! Piece of cake!
ULRICH: Yumi.
YUMI: What? What happened?
ODD: Sorry, no time to explain.\NWe’ve got to deactivate the tower.
AELITA: Jeremie’s not responding.\N I don’t understand.
AELITA: I have the feeling\Nthat something’s wrong.
ULRICH: He’s all alone with the other one.
ULRICH: If she destroys the scanner, it’s all over.
YUMI: The other? The other what?
YUMI: Who wants to wreck the scanner?
ODD: The other you.
YUMI: What if something\Nhas happened to Jeremie?
YUMI: And what if we don’t manage\Nto deactivate the tower in time?
YUMI: This is serious. Listen, one of us has to\Ngo back to reality and right away.
YUMI: We don’t have much time.
ULRICH: Right. I’ll go.
YUMI: No, it’s better if I go.
YUMI: I don’t know how many\Nlife points I have left, Ulrich,
YUMI: and if I only have five or ten,\NI won’t be of much use to you here.
YUMI: And also, I have a little matter\Nto deal with that only I can settle.
YUMI: It’s between me and myself.
ULRICH: Then you go.
ULRICH: But first you have to\Ndevirtualize yourself.
ULRICH: The question is how.
YUMI: You’re armed, aren’t you?
YUMI: You know what?
YUMI: You look just like me\Nwhen I’m having a bad day.
ODD: Uh-oh. We’ve got company.
AELITA: Odd, watch out.
AELITA: On your right.
ULRICH: How many life points do I have left?
ODD: I don’t know, but it’s\Ngot to be less than 10 by now.
JEREMIE: Yumi!
ODD: I’m still here?
ODD: Well, I guess I messed up\Non my calculations.
ULRICH: You always were\Na washout in math.
ODD: Right, but thanks to you\NI can count to three.
YUMI: Aaaah!
ULRICH: Triplicate!
ULRICH: Fusion.
ULRICH: Aelita, you’re up.
JEREMIE: Aaah!
YUMI: (CACKLES)
YUMI: Oh, no!
JEREMIE: Aaaaah!
AELITA: That’s fantastic!
AELITA: The fact that XANA was able to\Nmaterialize another Yumi
AELITA: proves one thing.
AELITA: It proves that materialization\Nis really possible.
YUMI: That’s crazy!
YUMI: XANA’s helping us\Nwith our materialization research!
ODD: Back to work then, Einstein.
JEREMIE: No sweat.
JEREMIE: I’ll start programming again right now.
ODD: But why bother?
ODD: If I were you, I’d go and see XANA.
ODD: He’s got the answer, so ask him!
ULRICH: I wouldn’t trust him.
ULRICH: Look at the Yumi he sent us.
ODD: Oh, yeah? She wasn’t\Nthat different from the original.
JEREMIE: She sure was!
JEREMIE: She didn’t fool me.
JEREMIE: I saw the difference as soon as\Nshe started to flirt with me.
YUMI: Really? Are you sure?
YUMI: Do you have any proof that it’s\Nthe real me you’re looking at?
JEREMIE: What are you doing?
ULRICH: Uh, no. Cut it out.
ULRICH: I’ve had enough of that for one day.
YUMI: You’re not jealous are you, Ulrich?
ODD: Sure looks like it!
