DR. DELACRE: Our heating plant uses energy\Nsupplied by nuclear reactor.
DR. DELACRE: Thanks to which, we produce thousands\Nof megawatts of electrical power.
DR. DELACRE: Here, we have the cooling tower.
DR. DELACRE: This is the turbine, the alternator,\Nand finally, the reactor.
SFX: (YAWNS)
DR. DELACRE: This plant is one of\Nthe most powerful in the world.
DR. DELACRE: As chief engineer, I am particularly\Nconcerned with safety.
DR. DELACRE: And to guarantee this safety,
DR. DELACRE: security measures have been applied\Nat every level of production.
DR. DELACRE: The plant’s design, its functioning,\Nand problem phases.
DR. DELACRE: We call this combination\Nof safety measures “in-depth defense.”
DR. DELACRE: I’ll be glad to answer any questions.
JEREMIE: Uh, sir.
MRS. HERTZ: Yes, go on, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: I’d like to know if an atomic process exists
JEREMIE: for fusing virtual particles\Nand materializing them in the real world.
DR. DELACRE: Mhmm.
DR. DELACRE: Son, that is in the realm of science fiction.
DR. DELACRE: Sorry.
MRS. HERTZ: Jeremie is an excellent student,\Nbut he’s a bit of a dreamer.
STUDENTS: (LAUGHTER)
MRS. HERTZ: Well, now. What’s happened here?
MRS. HERTZ: Oh, certainly nothing serious.\NJust a blown fuse, that’s all.
SFX: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
JEREMIE: And I’m saying that\Nmaybe XANA is behind this.
ODD: Don’t get so excited, Jeremie.\NIt was just a short circuit.
MR. DELMAS: Odd.
MR. DELMAS: I’ve thought it over.\NYou can form your group.
MR. DELMAS: The um…Foxtrot Fanatics.
ODD: Yes!
YUMI: It’s the Pop Rock Progressives, sir.
MR. DELMAS: But it must be open to\Nanyone who wishes to play.
MR. DELMAS: Is that clear?
ODD: No problemo, sir!
ODD: Yeah! Let’s hear it\Nfor the god of rock and roll!
ODD: Hey, come on. If we step on it,
ODD: we can photocopy the leaflets\Nbefore lunch, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Well, you know, Odd, I’m not into rock.
JEREMIE: Besides, I want to check on that outage.
YUMI: Okay. See you later, Jeremie.
AELITA: Hi.
AELITA: Is something wrong, Jeremie?
AELITA: You know, if you ever have a problem,
AELITA: you can always talk to me about it.
JEREMIE: Weird.
JEREMIE: Why can’t I hear anything?
JEREMIE: Let’s check this out.
JEREMIE: Aelita?
JEREMIE: Aelita, do you read me?
AELITA: Loud and clear, Jeremie.
AELITA: Is everything okay?
JEREMIE: We had a power failure\Nin class this morning,
JEREMIE: and the school electricity system\Nseems to be having problems.
AELITA: And?
AELITA: Do you think XANA’s behind it, Jeremie?
JEREMIE: You never know.
JEREMIE: Have you noticed anything on Lyoko?
AELITA: No.
AELITA: Everything’s quiet here.
JEREMIE: Okay. I’ll do a scan.
JEREMIE: If XANA’s activated a tower, we’ll find out soon.
AELITA: Where are you going?
JEREMIE: To the cafeteria.
JEREMIE: They’ve got brussel sprouts today.
JEREMIE: You know what they are?
AELITA: Yes, but I don’t know what they taste like.
AELITA: Are they good?
ULRICH: Ah! Eugh! They’re gross!
JIM: Odd, what are you up to now?
ODD: We’re holding auditions for our group.
ODD: Hey, if anyone is interested,\Nwe need a drummer!
ODD: Here. Here you go.
ODD: Let’s see now.
ODD: Hot chocolate, no. Soup, no.\NThe soup tastes like dishwater.
ODD: Hey, you pressed soup!
ULRICH: Come on, it’s not that awful.
ODD: Oh, this miserable machine’s on the blink again.
ODD: (GROANS)
JEREMIE: Maybe it’s another power failure.
YUMI: Are you worried?
JEREMIE: Yeah, I am.
JEREMIE: I’ll keep checking things out.
YUMI: If you need us, we’ll be in the gym.
YUMI: We’re gonna hold auditions.
SFX: (RAPID DRUMMING)
MIKE: Yeah! Hah!
ODD: Well, yeah, you’ve got a lot of style.\NIt’s heavy metal, right?
MIKE: Oh, yeah.\NFor sure. I love it!
YUMI: Really sorry, Mike, um,
YUMI: but we’re looking for something\Nmore traditional, you know?
ODD: Next.
NAOMI: Hello, guys.
ODD: Hey! How are you, Naomi?\NI didn’t know you played the drums!
NAOMI: Well, yeah, a little.
NAOMI: Besides, I’ve always\Ndreamed of being in a band.
ULRICH: Okay, then. Go on.
DEFAULT: (DISCORDANT DRUMMING)
ODD: Great, Naiomi! That was fantastic!\NWell, I mean, come on,
ODD: we’re not gonna\Nfind anyone better, right?
JEREMIE: 400,000 volts at a high-tension pylon?
JEREMIE: That’s not right.
JEREMIE: Aelita?
AELITA: Got anything new?
JEREMIE: Well, not really.
JEREMIE: Aelita!
JEREMIE: (PANTING)
JEREMIE: This is XANA’s doing!
JEREMIE: I’m almost sure of it.
YUMI: Yeah, go on?
JEREMIE: The current’s cutting out\Nall around the school,
JEREMIE: and the pylon outside\Nis way over the voltage limit.
JEREMIE: It could explode!
ULRICH: But why would XANA do that?
JEREMIE: Your guess is as good as mine, Ulrich.
SISSI: Surprise!
SISSI: It’s obvious my friends and I\Naren’t very welcome, but…
SISSI: my father did say that the band\Nwas open to everybody, right?
SISSI: Oh, but don’t worry.
SISSI: I don’t want to be in a group\Nof deadbeat weirdos.
SISSI: But Nicholas\Njust loves the drums.
ODD: A drummer, huh?
ODD: What does he play?\NHis mom’s pots and pans?
JEREMIE: Okay, guys.\NI’m off to the factory.
JEREMIE: Keep you posted.
DEFAULT: (TIGHT DRUMMING)
NICHOLAS: Yeah!
SISSI: Looks like you\Nfound yourself a drummer.
ODD: Nicholas?
ODD: The drummer in our band?
ODD: I don’t care how good he is--\Nthe answer is no.
ODD: Besides, Sissi set this up\Njust to give us a hard time.
YUMI: Maybe for once\Nshe was trying to help.
YUMI: And you’ve got to admit that\NNicholas can really play the drums.
ULRICH: Better than Naomi, that’s for sure.
ODD: She’s only a beginner!\NShe needs a little more time.
ULRICH: Uh-huh.\NA couple of years should do it.
ODD: Well, if that’s how you feel,\Nthen listen up.
ODD: If you want Nicholas\Nto be your drummer,
ODD: you’d better find yourself\Nanother guitarist.
YUMI: And I say if you don’t take him,
YUMI: you’d better find yourself\Na new singer.
ULRICH: If Sissi’s idea was to cause trouble,\Nshe’s done a great job.
SFX: (TROMBONE WHINES)
JIM: Uh, would you guys need\Na slide trombone, by any chance?
: (PULSING)
JEREMIE: Aelita.
JEREMIE: Sorry about the outage.\NWhat’s new?
AELITA: You were right to be worried.
AELITA: XANA’s woken up.
JEREMIE: Huh?
JEREMIE: The scan's picked something up.
JEREMIE: The tower XANA's activated\Nis in the desert region.
AELITA: I'm on my way.
JEREMIE: Be careful, Aelita.
AELITA: I will.
SFX: (SMOOTH TROMBONE)
JIM: Well, what do you say?
ODD: Uh, Jim, the fact is…
ODD: you see, we’re a rock band,\Nnot a military brass band.
SFX: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
YUMI: Okay. Be right there.
YUMI: We’re going to have to\Naudition you another time.
JIM: Oh, no you don’t!
JIM: You’re not going anywhere\Nunless you agree
JIM: to take me as\Npart of your group!
ODD: Jeremie, we’re on our way.
ODD: Yeah!
ODD: Yeah!
JEREMIE: Ah, at last.
JEREMIE: Here’s what XANA’s up to.
JEREMIE: Once he’s stored enough voltage\Nin that pylon, he’ll unleash it all.
ODD: Unleash it where?
JEREMIE: Guess. On the nuclear plant.
YUMI: Creating a short circuit and…
FIRST RESPONDER #1: I can’t manage to cut the power.
FIRST RESPONDER #1: I’ve tried everything.\NI’ve never seen such a weird thing.
JEREMIE: The pylon can take 1,000,000 volts.
JEREMIE: Once it’s all accumulated,\NXANA can blow everything up.
YUMI: Nuclear sabotage.
YUMI: That’s a little over our heads,\Nwouldn’t you say?
ULRICH: Yeah, what do you mean?
YUMI: Think about it. If we fail in Lyoko,\Nthe whole region will be wiped out.
YUMI: We’ve got to warn the authorities!
JEREMIE: Are you crazy?
JEREMIE: There’ll be an inquiry,\Nand we’ll be questioned.
JEREMIE: We’ll have to tell them everything.
JEREMIE: And if they discover XANA,\Nthey’ll pull all the plugs out.
YUMI: And we’ll lose Aelita.
YUMI: I know that.
YUMI: But we’re talking about\Na nuclear disaster.
JEREMIE: Okay.
JEREMIE: Let’s take a vote.\NWho’s for raising the alarm?
YUMI: For.
JEREMIE: Against.
ODD: Against.
ULRICH: Sorry, Aelita.
ULRICH: But I also think we can’t\Ntake that big a risk.
ULRICH: I vote for. Let’s report it.
JEREMIE: Well, then. Two votes for,\Nand two votes against. It’s a tie.
JEREMIE: We don’t tell anybody.
YUMI: I think it means that\Nwe should tell everybody.
AELITA: Don’t I have the right to vote?
JEREMIE: Why, sure you do.\NThat way there won’t be a tie.
AELITA: In that case, I vote for.
JEREMIE: Huh?
AELITA: I don’t want thousands of people\Nto die just to save me.
YUMI: Thank you, Aelita.
ODD: We’re gonna make it, huh, Ulrich?
ULRICH: I sure hope so, Odd.
JEREMIE: Okay, I’ve got it.
JEREMIE: The scan has located\Nthe activated tower.
JEREMIE: It’s in the desert region.\NNear an oasis.
AELITA: I know where it is. That way.\NOn the other plateau.
DR. DELACRE: I don’t get it.
DR. DELACRE: The plant is functioning perfectly,\Nbut the city’s in total darkness.
DR. DELACRE: No need for alarm, though.\NWe’re working on finding the reason.
DEFAULT: (KNOCKING)
YUMI: I’m sorry to disturb you, sir,\Nbut it’s really important.
YUMI: You’ve got to trust me.
YUMI: I know it’s gonna sound crazy, sir,\Nbut please hear me out.
YUMI: The nuclear plant\Nis in danger of blowing up!
ODD: I don’t believe this.
ODD: What’s going on?\NWhere is this tower?
AELITA: We can’t see it now,\Nbut it’s here alright.
AELITA: Look at XANA’s pulsations.\NThey all converge here.
JEREMIE: Come on, you can do it.\NYou can’t be too far away.
JEREMIE: You’ve got to find it fast--\Nthe pylon is gonna be overloaded soon!
YUMI: Jeremie?
YUMI: The principal and\NDr. Delâcre didn’t believe me.
JEREMIE: We’re going crazy here, too, Yumi.
JEREMIE: The pylon is 85 percent charged\Nand we can’t find the tower.
ODD: Huh?
ODD: I found it!
ULRICH: Hm?
AELITA: Huh?
ODD: We’ve been tricked.
ODD: There’s no water down there,\Njust a surface layer.
ODD: I’ll go and have a better look.
ODD: There!
ODD: Careful!
JEREMIE: Odd!
ODD: I hate those horrible krabs!
ULRICH: Aelita, it’s you they’re after.
ULRICH: Go on! Run!
ODD: Aelita!
JEREMIE: Thank you for saving Aelita.
JEREMIE: But things look bad here.
JEREMIE: Up to 95 percent.
JEREMIE: Soon, XANA will be able\Nto attack the nuclear plant.
SFX: (SIRENS WAILING)
FIRST RESPONDER #1: Can you repeat that?
YUMI: The voltage\Nthat built up in this pylon
YUMI: is going to be used to blow up\Nthe nuclear power plant, sir!
YUMI: How can you just stand there?\NDo something!
YUMI: Before it’s too late, huh!
FIRST RESPONDER #1: How do you know all that?
ULRICH: Go on. Go on.
ULRICH: Fusion. Come on,\Nyou only get one shot.
ODD: Ulrich, are you out of your mind?
AELITA: No!
JEREMIE: Come on, hurry!
JEREMIE: The pylon is over 98 percent!
ULRICH: Okay. It’s up to you, Aelita.
FIRST RESPONDER: A supercomputer in a factory?\NA virtual world?
YUMI: I swear. You have to believe me.
SFX: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
ODD: It’s gonna work.
JEREMIE: No!
YUMI: Oh, no!
JEREMIE: Ready for a return trip to the past, Odd?
ODD: Okay, hit it!
