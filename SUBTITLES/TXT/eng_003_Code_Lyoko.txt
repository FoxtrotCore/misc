JIM: (SNORING)
KIWI: (BARKS)
JIM: Hey!
JIM: What are you\Ndoing here, huh?
KIWI: (YAPPING)
JIM: You dumb dog!
JIM: Wait ’til I get\Nmy hands on you!
JIM: I’ll get you this time,\Nyou mangy mutt!
ODD: Yeah! Way to go, Kiwi!
KIWI: (BARKING)
JIM: Jeremie!\NYou mind telling me
: what you’re doing\Noutside at this hour?
JIM: And that, huh!
: What's that supposed to be?
: (TROMBONE)
JEREMIE: If I’d have had more time,\NI could’ve done the eyes better.
MR. DELMAS: I hope this will teach you\Na lesson, Jeremie.
MR. DELMAS: I don’t understand.\NA model student like you?
MR. DELMAS: You should be ashamed.
JEREMIE: Uh…yes, sir.
YUMI: -What did he say?\N-Well, tell us!
JEREMIE: He gave me detention\Nfor the whole week of vacation.
ODD: Cool!
: He really let you have it!
ULRICH: As punishments go,\Nyou’re a champion!
YUMI: I’m sure we couldn’t have\Ndone better than that!
JEREMIE: Anyway, XANA won’t get\Nany vacation this time.
NICHOLAS: Am I dreaming,\Nor does Jeremie look happy
: to be punished\Nfor the vacatoin?
HERB: Yeah, it sure is weird.
HERB: You’d almost think\Nhe did what he did
: because he wanted\Nto be punished.
HERB: I don’t get it.
NICHOLAS: Me neither.
NICHOLAS: And who’s this XANA\Nhe was talking about?
SISSI: Herb is right. It’s even\Nweirder than weird.
SISSI: And I’m gonna find out\Njust what’s going on.
NICHOLAS: Huh? What are you\Ngonna do?
NICHOLAS: Don’t you have to leave\Nwith your dad after school?
SISSI: A little change of schedule.
SISSI: Daddy, can I talk\Nto you for a minute?
MR. DELMAS: But, Sissi dear,\NI am very busy.
SISSI: It won’t take long.
SISSI: Well, you see, there’s this girl I know\Nwhose grades aren’t very good,
: and the best thing for her\Nwould be to study over the vacation,
SISSI: but she’s supposed to\Ngo to see her grandparents.
MR. DELMAS: I see. And who is this--?
SISSI: Shh! I’m coming to that!
SISSI: She knows that when she\Ngets to her grandparents’ house,
SISSI: she won’t feel like studying,\Nso what do you think she should do?
SISSI: She needs your advice as a principal!
MR. DELMAS: Well, my advice would be\Nto give up her vacation
MR. DELMAS: and stay home and study\Nfor her own good.
MR. DELMAS: What’s this girl’s name?\NPerhaps I could talk to her…
SISSI: You just did, daddy! It’s me!
SISSI: Thank you for the advice!\NI promise to study hard!
SISSI: Kiss grandma and grandpa for me!
ULRICH: You get to go and see your parents\Nat the other end of the planet,
ULRICH: Yumi’s off for a vacation\Nin the mountains, and what do I get?
ULRICH: A whole week of math tutoring.
ODD: If they think they can make
: a good student\Nout of you in one week,
ODD: well, I say good luck to them.
ODD: It sounds like mission\Nimpossible if you ask me.
YUMI: You’re sure you can manage\Non your own without us?
JEREMIE: No sweat, and if XANA\Nleaves me alone,
: I’ll be able to work on\NAelita’s materialization.
SISSI: Oh, don’t worry.\NHe’s not gonna be alone.
SISSI: I’m staying at school, too,\Nand I’ll look after him.
SISSI: I’ll be his guardian angel.
ODD: Wow, Jeremie, are you lucky.
JIM: Alright, young man.
JIM: You think this wall’s\Ngonna clean itself?
JIM: Get to work NOW!
SISSI: (CACKLING)
JIM: Go on, go on.
: Laugh while you\Nstill can, young lady.
JIM: Your father told me\Nto monitor your studying,
JIM: and that's what I intend to do!
JIM: Okay, now.
: Get to work\Nand clean that up.
ULRICH: I don’t know why,\Nbut all of a sudden,
ULRICH: my math tutoring\Ndoesn’t seem all that bad.
JIM: Come on, you can do\Nbetter than that!
JIM: A little more elbow grease!
JIM: Keep scrubbing.\NGo on, you can do it.
JIM: How’s that math problem?
: Making any progress solving it?
JIM: I sure hope so!
SISSI: Well, I’m a little bit stuck here.
SISSI: Maybe if I gave\NJeremie some help.
SISSI: My father always says that\Nmanual labor is good for the brain!
JIM: Huh, I guess all kids\Naren’t lazy, after all.
JIM: Good idea, Sissi.
JIM: Stay there.
JIM: I’ll go and get you a sponge.
SISSI: Oh, what a shame\Nto have to wipe all that off.
SISSI: I guess I’m not the first one\Nto recognize your talent.
SISSI: It’s really well done.\NA work of art.
SISSI: By the way, did you do it\Nall by yourself?
SISSI: Or did your friend XANA\Nhelp you a little, huh?
MUSIC: (SINISTER MUSIC)
SISSI: I overheard you talking\Nto the other kids about XANA.
SISSI: Is she your girlfriend?\NMaybe I know her.
SISSI: Come on, Jeremie, tell me.
JEREMIE: XANA’s the name\Nof a rock group.
JEREMIE: But with all the junk\Nthat you listen to,
JEREMIE: there’s no way you could\Npossibly know them.
SISSI: What do you think I am?
: An idiot or something?
JEREMIE: Uh, you said it, not me.
JEREMIE: Here. Since you\Nvolunteered to help me.
JEREMIE: It’s time I took a break.
JEREMIE: A little more elbow grease!
JEREMIE: Go on, keep scrubbing!
JEREMIE: You can do it!
JEREMIE: Go on, you can do better than that!
JIM: (CLEARS THROAT)
SISSI: Oh, I ache all over. I swear.
SISSI: I'm telling you, I'd have\Nnever thought it was possible
: to be this sore.\NIt even hurts to blink!
HERB: Sissi, you should go to sleep.
SISSI: Are you kidding? I can’t.
SISSI: What if Jeremie\Ntries something tonight!
HERB: Oh, yeah? What?
SISSI: I don't know,\Nbut he's up to something.
: I'm sure of that.
SISSI: And I’m almost sure that\Nthis XANA is in on it.
SISSI: Tonight’s the night.
SISSI: I’m going to play super spy.
SISSI: At last, I’m gonna find out the secret\Nof Jeremie and his weird friends!
JEREMIE: I know I’m on the right track,
JEREMIE: but I need the computer in the lab\Nto check out the figures.
JEREMIE: I’m gonna head over to the factory.
AELITA: You should go to bed, Jeremie.
AELITA: XANA seems to be stable.
AELITA: I don’t feel any pulsations.
AELITA: And you know\Nit’s not the end of the world
: if I stay virtual one more day.
JEREMIE: That’s fine for you,\Nbut if you don’t come soon,
JEREMIE: I’m gonna have to spend my vacation\Nwith Sissi and Jim.
JEREMIE: I’ll never survive.
AELITA: Jeremie, thank you.
AELITA: Thank you for everything you’re doing for me.
JEREMIE: That’s okay.
DEFAULT: (CRASHING)
JEREMIE: (COUGHING)
DEFAULT: Aaaah!
JIM: Now, don’t try to tell me\Nthat you were sleepwalking
JIM: because I’ve been\Nworking here for 20 years,
JIM: and I’ve heard that story about…
JEREMIE: Jim, something awful has happened!
JEREMIE: Have a look! In there!
JIM: Huh?
: Looks like there was a hurricane in there.\NThis had better not be your doing.
JEREMIE: But the smoke! It’s disappeared!
JEREMIE: That’s weird. Not even a trace.
JEREMIE: It’s XANA.
JIM: Don’t even think about leaving this room.\NTomorrow, I’m calling your parents.
JIM: You’ve got some explaining to do.
JIM: I wouldn’t want to be in your shoes.
JEREMIE: Aelita! Come in, please. Hurry.
JEREMIE: We’ve got a big problem.
AELITA: You’re not the only one. \NXANA’s woken up.
AELITA: But I don’t know which tower he’s activated.
AELITA: But the pulsation converge in this direction.
JEREMIE: It’s even worse than I thought.
JEREMIE: The spilled bottles contain\Nan extremely poisonous substance.
JEREMIE: If the computer is right,\Nthe gas can even be deadly
JEREMIE: in cases of extended inhalation.
JIM: Get up, young man. Time to face the music.
JIM: Huh?
JIM: Jeremie!
SISSI: W-What’s happening? Where am I?
SISSI: Jeremie!
SISSI: I can’t see. I’m totally out of it!
SISSI: What’s going on?
SISSI: (SCREAMS)
SISSI: Jim! Over there! Smoke! With arms!
JIM: This has got to be contagious.\NWhat’s all this about smoke, anyway?
JIM: Come on, I don’t see any--
JIM: Waaaah!
JEREMIE: Bingo.
JEREMIE: Aelita, I found it.
JEREMIE: 37 degrees south in the forest area.
AELITA: Okay, I’m on my way.
AELITA: But I’m nowhere near it,\Nand I’m gonna need some help.
JEREMIE: I know three volunteers who will be happy\Nto cut their vacation short and help.
TUTOR: You’ll soon learn that mathematics\Nis actually quite easy, young man.
TUTOR: All you need is a sense of logic,\Na little bit of common sense,
TUTOR: and, of course, if you have good\Nconcentration skills, and if you have…
ULRICH: “S.O.S XANA--Jeremie.”
TUTOR: …analysis, that will help as well,\Nbut I assure you, if you apply yourself,
TUTOR: it’s not at all complicated.
SECURITY PERSON #1: Hey, come and have a look at this, Charlie.
SECURITY PERSON #2: What is it?
SECURITY PERSON #2: Wow, that’s incredible!
SECURITY PERSON #1: What is that, kid?
ODD: Uh…it’s a…
ODD: Looks like a skeleton!
SECURITY PERSON #2: Yeah, that’s right, but, uh,\Ndon’t you see anything strange?
SECURITY PERSON #1: Your skeleton is moving.
ODD: Oh, that’s Kiwi!
ODD: Kiwi’s my dog.
SECURITY PERSON #1: You do know that dogs are only\Nallowed in the luggage compartment?
ODD: Well, yeah sure, uh…
ODD: I don’t know what happened!
ODD: He was supposed to stay here…
: with my grandma, but…
SECURITY PERSON #2: Mhmm.
SECURITY PERSON #2: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
ODD: Oh, it’s gram!
ODD: We were just talking about you!
JEREMIE: What are you talking about, Odd?
JEREMIE: It’s me, Jeremie.
ODD: Yes, of course I know it’s you, gram!
ODD: I’m sorry.
: I know you’ve told me a hundred times\Nthat you don’t like me to call you gram!
ODD: Yeah, okay.
ODD: I’m on my way. Right.
ODD: I’ll bring back the dog.
ODD: Bye, gram.
MR. ISHIYAMA: We should have left over two hours ago.
YUMI: You know how much she loves that dress.
MR. ISHIYAMA: I don’t even know\Nwhat dress she’s talking about.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: I’m coming! I’ll be down in two seconds!
YUMI: Yeah, I doubt that.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: You’re going to laugh,\Ndarling, when I tell you…
MR. ISHIYAMA: No, I don’t really feel like laughing.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Have you noticed someone\Nis missing in the back seat?
SISSI: Oh, no!
JIM: (COUGHING)
JIM: Over here. Hurry up!
AELITA: Jeremie, I’m coming into the forest area now.
JEREMIE: Yumi, Ulrich, and Odd\Nshould be there very soon.
JEREMIE: Be careful, Aelita.
JEREMIE: There are bound to be monsters around there.
JEREMIE: I better go back to the school.
JEREMIE: Jim and Sissi might be in trouble.
JEREMIE: I’ve got to warn them.
JIM: Help! Help us!
SISSI: Help!
SISSI: It’s not use. We’re finished.
JIM: No, no. We’re not finished.
JIM: Be brave, now.
JIM: Jeremie can’t be far away.
JIM: He’ll help us out of this!
SISSI: Jeremie? That’s pretty reassuring.
SISSI: It’s nice to know that the closest thing\Nto Bruce Willis is coming to the rescue.
JEREMIE: Sissi? Jim? Where are you?
ULRICH: We’ll cut across through\Nthe boiler room. It's faster.
JEREMIE: (COUGHING)
YUMI: Through the park.
ULRICH: Jeremie!
JEREMIE: Jim and Sissi are still inside.\NWe’ve got to find them.
ULRICH: I’ll go.
YUMI: Ulrich, wait!
JEREMIE: Yumi, the factory.
JEREMIE: You’ve got to go and help Aelita.
YUMI: Hang on, Jeremie.
YUMI: Odd, you got here in the nick of time.
ODD: Where’s Ulrich?
SISSI: I only stayed at school to try and find out\Nthe secret of Jeremie and his friends
SISSI: because the truth is that I’ve been wanting\Nto be part of their group for ages,
: but it seems so hopeless.
SISSI: Do you understand what I mean?
JIM: Huh? No.
JIM: All I understand is that\Nthere’s no ventilation in here.
JIM: We’re gonna run out of oxygen soon.
SISSI: I’d better stop talking then, right?
SISSI: Okay. I can take a hint.
NEWS ANCHOR: A strange and toxic smoke\Nwhose origins are unknown.
NEWS ANCHOR: The elderly and children\Nare advised to remain indoors.
JEREMIE: Odd.
JEREMIE: Help me get over to the computer.
JEREMIE: (COUGHING)
JEREMIE: And get ready to dive in.\NStop looking at me! Come on!
JEREMIE: There’s no time to lose!
JEREMIE: Transfer Yumi.
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE: Scanner Yumi.
JEREMIE: Scanner Odd.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
ODD: Where do we go now?
AELITA: The activated tower is over this way.
YUMI: Hi, Aelita!
YUMI: Have you seen any monsters?
AELITA: Not yet.
ODD: Guess you didn’t look very hard!
JEREMIE: Ulrich, do you copy?
JEREMIE: How’s it going?
ULRICH: Still nothing.
ULRICH: I’ve been through most of the building.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, get out of there.
JEREMIE: You can’t stay in that smoke any longer.\NIt's too dangerous.
JEREMIE: And they may be outside already.
ULRICH: I-I’ll try one last room. Then I’ll go.
ULRICH: (COUGHING)
ULRICH: Jim!
ULRICH: Jim! Sissi! Are you in there?
JEREMIE: Ulrich, get out right now!
JEREMIE: Ulrich! Come on!
JEREMIE: What’s going on!
JEREMIE: Ulrich, answer me!
JEREMIE: Look, I don’t want\Nto rush you, my friends,
JEREMIE: but it’s getting kind of urgent here.
ODD: What about us?
ODD: What do you think we’re doing, huh?
ODD: Getting a suntan?
YUMI: Odd, watch out.
JEREMIE: You okay, Yumi?
YUMI: No broken bones yet.
JEREMIE: Take good care of Aelita.
JIM: There. You see, Sissi?
JIM: I told you he’d come and rescue us.
JIM: What the…Ulrich!
SISSI: He came for me!
SISSI: Oh, he came to save me!\NIt’s just like I always dreamed!
JEREMIE: The only way to access the tower\Nis via a tree bridge.
JEREMIE: But it happens to be behind the monsters,
JEREMIE: and so you’re gonna have to\Nfind a way around them.
YUMI: I might have an idea\Nfor blocking the monsters.
YUMI: You take care of Aelita.
ODD: Laser flash!
JEREMIE: Yumi! If she gets hit one more time…
YUMI: Jeremie!
JEREMIE: Welcome to Earth, Yumi.
JIM: Hey, look. A cell phone!
JIM: Now we’ll be able to\Ncall for help.
JEREMIE: Jim, is that you, huh?
JIM: Jeremie!
JEREMIE: Where are you? And Ulrich?
JIM: Jeremie, we really need help.
JIM: We’re starting to run out of oxygen in here.
JIM: Oh, no!
JEREMIE: Jim, what’s happening?
JEREMIE: Jim!
JEREMIE: Odd, hurry up!
ODD: Well, what do we do now?
AELITA: You take care of the monsters.
SFX: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
ODD: Hey, you!
ODD: That’s right. You.
ODD: Laser flash!
JEREMIE: Let’s hope it’s not too late.
JEREMIE: Aelita, hurry up!
JEREMIE: Return to the past now.
ULRICH: I don’t understand why you insist on
ULRICH: getting punished with\Ndetention again, Jeremie.
ULRICH: Come on, XANA’s not\Ngonna reactivate this soon.
ULRICH: You could get yourself a short vacation.
JEREMIE: Not as long as Aelita stays virtual.
JEREMIE: And this time, to tell you the truth,
JEREMIE: considering what we’ve painted,\NJim can’t be too angry!
ULRICH: Come to think of it,\NI’m gonna stick around.
ULRICH: Anything is better than another one\Nof Mrs. Schmitt’s math lessons.
ULRICH: Even Jim.
KIWI: (BARKING)
JIM: Get back here!
