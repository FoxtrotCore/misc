ODD: You’re not the only one.
ODD: You’re wrong, I tell you!
JEREMIE: But I didn’t say that Kiwi was stupid.
ODD: Oh, no. You said he was brainless.
JEREMIE: Yeah, well if you throw him a stick, he won’t run and fetch it.
ODD: Well, neither would you.
ODD: Does that make you brainless?
ROSA: Franks and beans or ravioli?
TAMIYA: Hey, what’s he doing there?

MILLY: She looked like Doctor Shrank!
JEREMIE: Who’s Doctor Shrank?
ODD: The psycho TV brain surgeon\Nin Hospital of Horrors.

ODD: And we’ve got to join him ASAP.
WILLIAM: Hey, where do you think you’re going?
JEREMIE: Uh, outside.
WILLIAM: No way--it’s too dangerous.
ODD: That’s our problem, William.
WILLIAM: Sorry.
WILLIAM: I’m the oldest one here,
WILLIAM: so I’m the one responsible for the group.
WILLIAM: And I’m telling you you’re\Nstaying here and waiting for help.
WILLIAM: I don’t want the zombies to get you,
WILLIAM: and what’s more, if they\Nattack the cafeteria again,
WILLIAM: we’ll need as many of us here as possible.
WILLIAM: Anyone who tries to get out
WILLIAM: has got to get past me first, understand?
ODD: Oh, great. William thinks he’s Bruce Willis.
ODD: That’s all we needed.
ULRICH: What do I do now?
ULRICH: Can’t get through.
ULRICH: Hey Sissi, listen,\Nwe’ve got to get to a safe spot.

WILLIAM: A supercomputer that lets you\Ngo into a virtual universe
WILLIAM: where you have to battle\Nan evil enemy called XANA?
JEREMIE: Uh, yes.
JEREMIE: When you put it that way,\NI admit it sounds a little weird.
AELITA: If you want to stop this zombie attack,
AELITA: Odd, Jeremie, and I have to\Nget to the factory right now.
WILLIAM: Look, I’m sorry, but I don’t believe you,\Nso we’re all staying together.
ODD: Okay. Plan B.
ODD: I’ll distract him and you take off with Aelita.
ODD: Hey, Jackie Chan,
ODD: so you think you’re the boss\Naround here or something?
WILLIAM: Yes, and I want us all to\Nget out of this unharmed.
ODD: You’ve got to stop watching\Nthose superhero films!
ODD: It’s getting into your head!
HERB: Look, they’re getting away!
AELITA: Jeremie!
WILLIAM: Hey, you!
WILLIAM: Sorry, but it’s for your own good.

OFFICER #1: You haven’t seen anything suspicious
OFFICER #1: going on around here on the campus?
OFFICER #1: Uh, zombies? Living dead?
MR. ROUILLER: Huh?
MR. ROUILLER: No, uh, but I haven’t\Nbeen out of my gatehouse.
MR. ROUILLER: As far as I know, everything’s normal.
OFFICER #1: I told you it was just another\Nstupid kid’s prank, right?
OFFICER #1: Let’s go. Thank you. Good night.
ULRICH: Hey, Jeremie, it’s me.
ULRICH: Are you at the factory?
JEREMIE: Still not there.
JEREMIE: This joker William won’t let us out.
ULRICH: Right. I’ll see what I can do.
MR. ROUILLER: Hey, Jim!
MR. ROUILLER: You heard this thing about some zombies?
MR. ROUILLER: It’s completely nutty!
SISSI: Look!
SFX: (MOANING)
ULRICH: Well, so much for the way out of here.
SFX: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
ULRICH: Yumi?
YUMI: What in the world have you guys been up to?
YUMI: I’ve been waiting for you at the factory.
ULRICH: Haven’t you heard?
ULRICH: It’s a living dead convention over here.
ULRICH: I’m trying to find a way\Nto get Aelita to the factory,
ULRICH: but it’s not gonna be easy.
YUMI: Okay. Be careful.
ODD: They’re coming from all sides.
ODD: Wait, there’s Kiwi! Look!
ODD: He found me!
ODD: See how smart he is?
ODD: My little diggity dog!
MILLY: Hey…
MILLY: That’s the same dog\Nwe saw in the hallway
MILLY: just before Tamiya got zombified.
MILLY: Wait, Odd!
ODD: Ow!
ODD: Kiwi, what’s wrong with you?
ODD: XANA.
JEREMIE: William, quick.
JEREMIE: We have to tie him up.
WILLIAM: Hurry up!
ODD: (GROANING)
SISSI: You got a plan?
ULRICH: Yeah.
ULRICH: But I’m not sure you’re gonna like it.
WILLIAM: So, you’re saying that Kiwi\Nis possessed by this--this XANA?
JEREMIE: Right. But now, thanks to you,
JEREMIE: Kiwi’s somewhere ready to bite us.
JEREMIE: What’s more, we’re surrounded\Nby an army of the living dead.
JEREMIE: If you had let us out before,\Nwe wouldn’t be in this mess.
WILLIAM: Listen, if you had gone out,
WILLIAM: you might be a zombie\Nyourself by now, idiot!
WILLIAM: I’m getting tired of hearing about\Nthis factory and your supercomputer!
SFX: (MOANING)
ULRICH: Are you ready?
SISSI: Uh-huh.
ULRICH: Kill the zombie-e-e-e-s!
ULRICH: Come on, you dead-heads!
SISSI: Open up!
SISSI: It’s me—Sissi!
SISSI: Hey! Open up, I said!
SISSI: I’m not one of them!
HERB: She’s lying.
HERB: Prove it.
SISSI: Um…I, uh…
SISSI: I have a subscription\Nto Pretty Girl,
SISSI: and I still sleep with Ninin,\Nmy stuffed moose.
HERB: That has nothing to do with it.
HERB: That just proves you’re a lame-o.
SFX: (MOANING)
SISSI: You open this door, you\Nbunch of pea-brained dorks!
NICHOLAS: Okay, that’s Sissi alright.
JEREMIE: Come on! It’s now or never!
WILLIAM: (GRUNTS)
ULRICH: That one’s on me.
YUMI: Hiyah!
YUMI: Uh!
YUMI: Hurry up. Let’s get\Nback to the factory.
JEREMIE: Get into the scanners.
JEREMIE: I’ll start the virtualization process.
JEREMIE: Okay, ladies.
JEREMIE: We’re ready to roll.
JEREMIE: Transfer Yumi.
JEREMIE: Transfer Aelita.
JEREMIE: Scanner Yumi.
JEREMIE: Scanner Aelita.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
JEREMIE: And here’s the overwing.
YUMI: Wow, you’re getting better, Jeremie.
YUMI: Soon, we’ll be landing\Nright on top of them!
JEREMIE: Okay. On your way.
JEREMIE: And watch out for nasty surprises.
SISSI: What are they doing?
ULRICH: If you ask me,\Nthey’re preparing a final assault.
MILLY: (CRYING)
SISSI: It’s okay.
YUMI: Activated tower in sight.
AELITA: Krabs also in sight.
JEREMIE: XANA’s played his cards right.
JEREMIE: He wanted to bring you onto Lyoko,
JEREMIE: but with the fewest bodyguards possible.
JEREMIE: That’s why Kiwi bit Odd,\Nbut not you or me.
JEREMIE: Be careful.
JEREMIE: But now XANA doesn’t\Nneed me anymore.
YUMI: What do you mean?
JEREMIE: You’ve got to deactivate the tower fast.
JEREMIE: If I get zombified, I won’t be able\Nto launch the return in time,
JEREMIE: And then…I don’t want to talk\Nabout the mess we’ll be in!
YUMI: Ready, Aelita?
AELITA: Mhmm.
YUMI: Okay!
YUMI: We’re gonna try to push our way through.
JEREMIE: That’s suicide!
JEREMIE: If you don’t make it, Aelita will be\Nalone with the scyphozoa!
ULRICH: Okay, guys. This is it.
ROSA: Oh, I think I’m…
ROSA: (GROANS)
AELITA: They’re on our tail.
JEREMIE: Ladies, I hope you know what you’re doing.
YUMI: Yeah. So do I, Jeremie.
DEFAULT: Aah! Help!
HERB: No!
YUMI: Take my fan.
YUMI: Hurry!
YUMI: Now!
AELITA: Hiyah!
SFX: (ENGINE STALLING)
YUMI: Miserable kankrelat.
YUMI: We’ll have to go on foot.
YUMI: Go ahead. I’ll take care of it.
YUMI: Don’t drag your feet!
YUMI: Oh, no.
AELITA: Jeremie, the tower has disappeared.
YUMI: Maybe we went the wrong way.
JEREMIE: No, the tower is there.
JEREMIE: I can see it on my screen.
AELITA: You’re right, Jeremie.
AELITA: It’s straight ahead.
AELITA: How are we gonna get to it?
YUMI: I can tele-transport Aelita.
JEREMIE: You’re crazy!
JEREMIE: If you fail, she’ll fall\Nright into the digital sea!
YUMI: You have a better idea?
AELITA: I trust her, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Yumi!
JEREMIE: Yumi!
JEREMIE: Behind you!
AELITA: Aah!
AELITA: (SCREAMS)
KIWI: (GROWLING)
AELITA: Yumi!
AELITA: Aah!
YUMI: (GROANS)
AELITA: A-a-a-a-h!
AELITA: It’s one of XANA’s tricks.
JEREMIE: Aelita…
AELITA: (PANTING)
AELITA: Jeremie, a krab!
JEREMIE: Keep going.
JEREMIE: Normally, it wouldn’t dare fire at you.
JEREMIE: Yes!
JEREMIE: Hah-ha! Nice job!
JEREMIE: Ow!
JEREMIE: Oh, no.
SISSI: Don’t you touch Milly, you hear!
ULRICH: Odd?!
AELITA: Jeremie, did you program\Nthe return to the past?
AELITA: Jeremie?
AELITA: Tower deactivated.
JEREMIE: Aelita!
JEREMIE: (MOANS)
JEREMIE: Return to the past now!
JEREMIE: You see? I didn’t even get that.
MILLY: Sissi, what do you think\Nabout your father’s decision
MILLY: to set up a language exchange\Nprogram with France?
MILLY: Our readers want to know.
SISSI: My dear Milly, your paper\Ndoesn’t have any readers.
SISSI: And anyway, I don’t need the whole school
SISSI: knowing what I think, understand?
SISSI: Coming?
MILLY: Oh, I hate her.
ULRICH: It’s true that she’s a pain,\Nbut you know, deep down,
ULRICH: I think she really likes you.
AELITA: And I really think that\Nshe can be very brave
AELITA: and a real nice person
AELITA: when she wants to be.
MILLY: What?
JEREMIE: Yeah.
JEREMIE: In fact, you never can guess\Na person’s true colors, can you?
