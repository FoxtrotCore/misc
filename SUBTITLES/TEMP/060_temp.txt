 YUMI: What took you so long? I almost didn’t wait.


ODD: Just having a word with Lucy Ann.


YUMI: Lucy Anne?


ODD: Yeah, you know, Lucy Anne. I love giving nicknames to the monsters
I blow to smithereens.


Laser arrow!


ULRICH: Guess she wasn’t too crazy about her name.


ODD: You oughta take better care of your stuff, Ulrich.


JEREMIE: Aelita, I’m trying to collect more data on Franz Hopper,
but I can’t access the subsystems.


Be careful! {/i1}Flying mantas coming your way at ten o’clock!{i0}


YUMI: Jeremie? How’s everything going,
because around here, things are kind of-- ah!


...heating up.


JEREMIE: Not great. For now, I don’t have any data that tells me how to locate
Franz Hopper, I’m afraid. You’ll have to hold out a little longer.


ULRICH: Easier for you to say!


AELITA: I’m almost there. I’m about ready to access the subsystems.


ODD: How many life points do we have left?


JEREMIE: Not many. If you get hit by one more flying manta,
it’ll be game over, Odd. Same goes for you, Ulrich.


ODD: Buckle up, Shirley!


Ethel, Yvette! Get back here right now!


ULRICH: Odd, cut it out with your dumb names, huh?


What’s going on here? Why aren’t we devirtualized?


ODD: Laser arrow!


AELITA: Huh? What’s that?


ULRICH: Beats me. They shot at us, and this is what happened.


JEREMIE: You guys okay? All in one piece, I hope.


ULRICH: Yeah, think so.


ODD: {/i1}Two great legs, a svelte torso, two little arms, and a good looking head.{i0}
No, nothing missing!


AELITA: Jeremie, what happened out there?


JEREMIE: I wish I knew. I have to look back over the quantum sequence to track any
abnormalities in the access data.


YUMI: Mind translating that, Einstein?


AELITA: He has to carry out a full check.


ODD: Oh, no way, there’s no time! We’ve got rehearsal in exactly five minutes!


JEREMIE: Rehearsal? Oh no, I completely forgot about it!
Chardin’s gonna kill us!


NICOLAS: Boo! We want our money back, we want our money back,
we want our money back, we want our money back, we want our money back!


JIM: Poliakoff, do you mind using your head for once? How can you get your
money back from a show that’s totally free?


NICOLAS: Well, you, uh…


JIM: We would have to give you back nothing,
which, if you ask me, is too much.


Besides, try showing some respect! Theater, don’t forget, is sacred!


Believe me. I know from experience. Years ago, I even wrote a one-act…
well, actually, it was more of a one-scene play.


HERB: Oh really? What was it about, Jim?


JIM: Hmmm, I’d rather not talk about it.

MR. CHARDIN: Phew, there you are. Please everyone, hurry up.


MR. DELMAS: Well, Mr. Chardin, what made you choose Cyrano de Bergerac
for this years performance? The elegance of the text, I imagine?


Or the tragedy of unrequited love, or perhaps it appeals to
your true, but hidden romantic nature?


MR. CHARDIN: Lack of money.


Since we had no choice, we had to use last year’s Romeo and Juliet set
and the costumes. I had to find another play that had a balcony.


So, Cyrano.


MR. DELMAS: Hmm.


I see.


ULRICH: Roxanne!


YUMI: Who calls me?


ULRICH: It is I, Christian!


YUMI: Today, your words are hesitant.


ODD: Night has come. In the dusk, they grope their way to find your ear.


YUMI: But my words find no such impediment!


ODD: They find their way at once? Oh, small wonder that,
for it is within my heart they find their home.


Methink how large my heart, how small your ear.


And from their fair heights descending, words fall fast, but mine
must mount, madame. They need more laser arrows!


DEFAULT: (GASPS)


YUMI: Me thinks that your last words have learned to climb!


ODD: With practice, such gymnastics grow as hard! In truth, I seem to speak
from distant heights!


ULRICH: Two Kankrelats, dead ahead!


ODD: True, far above at such a height, toward death if--
Oh, okay, I’ll get them!


MR. DELMAS: Stern, Della Robbia, what are you babbling about!?


MR. CHARDIN: Please sir, keep it down. Don’t you know cutting-edge theater
when you see it? It’s a modern approach. 


Somewhere between the Bald Soprano
and a deadly karate match.


ODD: Take that, you old--
Ulrich, help me, I’m hit!


MR. CHARDIN: Bravo!


ULRICH: Super sprint!


YUMI: Cut it out! Your gag is not funny, it’s lame!


ULRICH: Yumi, what are you doing, you made me miss the Megatank!


AELITA: Odd, what’s gotten into you?


ODD: Out of the way, Aelita, I can’t see the Krab!


MR. DELMAS: This time, you’ve gone too far! One more word out of you,
and it’s a disciplinary committee, you hear?


JEREMIE: Wait, please, Mr. Delmas!
There’s something wrong, Odd isn’t himself!


ODD: Jeremie?


Does Xana have a broken hard disk or what? The Krab sounds
a lot like Delmas!


ULRICH: Odd, watch out! A Blok at four o’clock!


JIM: A Blok? You’re the blockhead, Stern.


Quick, someone call an ambulance! Stern and Della Robbia
have totally lost it!


ULRICH: Get your-- aaagh!


DEFAULT: (GASPS)


ODD: Jeremie, reload me! Two Tarantulas are getting the better of us!


ULRICH: We’re stuck in another of Xana’s traps!


ODD: Jeremie, do something!


MR. DELMAS:


Mhmm. So this is what happens when you spend hours--
--playing video games and watching cartoons on TV.


Rehearsal is over.


AELITA: Ulrich’s right, they are stuck in another of Xana’s traps.


JEREMIE: Go follow them to the hospital.
I’ll see if I can figure out what’s happening in the meantime.


DEFAULT: Did you give them something to calm them down?
Mhmm.


Now, tell me, are you having some problems at the moment?


Are you sleeping well?


Nightmares?


Restless nights?


Troubles at school? With your parents?


ODD: Take that, you rotten old Blok!


SFX: (ARROWS FIRING)


DEFAULT: Rotten… old… Blok. Interesting.


ULRICH: Let me at it!


DEFAULT: Hm?


ULRICH: Ow!


DEFAULT: Sorry, young man, but I’m a tenth dan in aikido.


JEREMIE: Huh?

YUMI: Yes, Jeremie?


JEREMIE: {/i1}Yumi, Xana is definitely behind Odd and Ulrich’s madness.{i0}


There’s only one way to make them normal,
and that’s to get them to a waytower somewhere on Lyoko.


{/i1}Then I can launch a program to get their heads straight.


YUMI: You mean we have to spring them from the hospital?


JEREMIE: {/i1}You got it.


YUMI: Hello, we’re here to see Ulrich Stern and Odd Della Robbia.


DEFAULT: I’m sorry, but they’re both under observation. No visitors allowed.


YUMI: Thanks a lot. Sorry we interrupted you.


AELITA: What do we do now?


YUMI: Quiet, listen.


DEFAULT: The two young men in room 237 are fighting--
--imaginary enemies they call Bloks, Megatanks, and Xana.


(LAUGHS)


Where do they get such crazy names from?
What do you think, Professor Hornet?


Typical of today’s youth.


YUMI: Now we know what room they’re in.


Leave him to me.


DEFAULT: Huh?


YUMI: Ooh, excuse me, man.


DEFAULT: Do you need any help?


YUMI: I’m… I-I’m looking for my room. Room, uh, 216.


DEFAULT: Come with me.


ODD: Aelita, watch out for the Krabs!


AELITA: What Krabs?


ULRICH: The ones blocking us!


AELITA: Energy field!

SFX: (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)


DEFAULT: (YELLING)
AELITA: That’s one down.


ODD: Nice job! That Krab just wouldn’t let go of me!
I think it was love at first bite.


DEFAULT: Here you are. Room 216.


YUMI: Thank you for showing me the way.


DEFAULT: Game of tiddlywinks?


AELITA: I’ve located the activated tower. Follow me.


ULRICH: Go, we’ll cover you.


DEFAULT: Whoever wins gets to take the other person’s medicine!
Well, what do you say?


YUMI: Huh? Uh, no thanks, maybe another time.


DEFAULT: What is going on around here? If you didn’t come for a game of tiddlywinks,
the what are you doing in my room, young lady?


YUMI: Well, um…


DEFAULT: You little rascal, you! Get out, or I’ll call the nurse!


AELITA: Yumi, now that you’re here, we can go to the activated tower.


YUMI: Oh right, yeah, sure, well, let’s get going then!


JEREMIE: Okay, I sure hope that this is gonna work.


DEFAULT: Huh?


Where do you think you’re going?


ODD: The Bloks caught up with us!

AELITA: No time!


DEFAULT: Out of my way!


Hello, is this police headquarters?


JEREMIE: Oh no, that’s all we needed. The Core is being attacked!
Come on, will you pick up?


YUMI: Yes, Jeremie?


Okay, we’re on our way!
Xana is attacking the Core of Lyoko!


JEREMIE: I hope they get here in time.


SFX: (POLICE SIRENS WAIL)
AELITA: Just a little further, the tower’s not far now.


YUMI: That way!


ULRICH: Go ahead, I’ll take care of the Megatank.


YUMI: Ulrich, no!


DEFAULT: Huh? What is this crazy kid trying to do?


Well, tell us what it feels like to be part of the evening news!


ULRICH: That should take care of them.


JEREMIE: Where could they be?


Huh, there you are, it’s about time. Only one more shield left
protecting the Core of Lyoko.


ODD: Jeremie, would you mind sending me the Overboard, ‘cause I’m getting tired
of running around!


AELITA: Any idea how we can get them into the scanners?


JEREMIE: Leave it to me, Aelita.


Okay guys, you made it there. Now head for that waytower!


ULRICH: Right.


Huh?

AELITA: Nice one, Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Transfer, Odd.
Transfer, Ulrich.


Transfer, Yumi.
Scanner, Odd.


Scanner, Ulrich.


Scanner, Yumi.


Virtualization.


ULRICH: Huh?


ODD: Woah, it’s empty out here. Not a kid in sight.


ULRICH: Guess they’re all in the lunchroom.


YUMI: Uh, yeah.


JEREMIE: {/i1}Your turn, Aelita.


Transfer, Aelita.


{/i1}Scanner, Aelita.


Virtualization.


YUMI: This is getting worse and worse.
Now they think they’re at the academy.


Listen, Aelita, you lead them to the waytower,
I’ll head for the Core of Lyoko.


AELITA: Got it.


Let’s go to the, um… lunchroom!


ODD: I’m starving!


JEREMIE: Welcoming committee, straight ahead.
Be careful, Aelita.


AELITA: No…


I don’t believe it.


ODD: Hey, Sissi! In a bad mood?
You break the scale this morning?


AELITA: No…


(CELESTIAL HUMMING)


ULRICH: What’s this?


ODD: They put Sissi and her pals in a display case or what?


YUMI: {/i1}Jeremie, I’m here, at the edge of the sector! Can you send me a taxi?


JEREMIE: You bet! A big, white stretch limo is on the way!


ULRICH: Who’s the dork that pushed me into Sissi’s arms?


AELITA: Energy field!


JEREMIE: Holosphere system connected.


YUMI: {/i1}Jeremie, I’m in the core zone.


JEREMIE: Okay Yumi, great. The countdown started.
You’ve got less than one minute to activate the key.


YUMI: Okay.


AELITA: Energy field.


ODD: Energy field? You think we’re on Lyoko or something?


ULRICH: Ow! Something just stung me.


JEREMIE: Better hurry up, Yumi.
You’ve only got ten seconds left.


Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, {/i1}three, two, one, zero!{i0}


Nice job, Yumi. Now head for the Celestial Dome.


YUMI: I’m on my way!


JEREMIE: {/i1}I’m programming your Overwing.


AELITA: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)


That way, hurry up!


ODD: No, the lunchroom is that way!


AELITA: Listen to me, both of you. 
You’re going to do exactly as I say, and no questions. You got that?


ULRICH: Okay.


ODD: Okay.


YUMI: Jeremie, I’m in the Dome.


AELITA: Now get in there. That’s an order!


DEFAULT: Ma’am, yes ma’am!


JEREMIE: Let’s hope this works.


Let’s see if this program is operational.


AELITA: How do you guys feel?


ULRICH: Fine, but what are we doing inside a waytower?


ODD: I don’t get it. Shouldn’t we be in the lunchroom?


AELITA: I’ll explain later.


Jeremie, it worked.


JEREMIE: Yeah, but the Core is still in danger.


YUMI: Jeremie, looks like I’m gonna need some help!


JEREMIE: It’s on the way.
By now, Ulrich and Odd should be close to Sector Five, Yumi.


Hurry up, Yumi needs your help!


Yumi, the last protective shield is about ready to go!


YUMI: I’m doing all I can!


ODD: Yahoo!


JEREMIE: Be careful, all of the Core’s shields are gone. If it takes one hit, just one,
{/i1}Lyoko is gone for good, and you guys along with it.{i0}


ULRICH: Oh, great.


AELITA: No!


ODD: Yeah!


JEREMIE: {/i1}Nice work, guys! Time to bring it back in.


YUMI: Well?


ODD: Well what? Laser arrow!


Nah, just kidding, ladies.


DEFAULT: Very funny.


JEREMIE: {/i1}Right. Well, it’s a good things that while some--
--people are clowning around, others keep working.


Okay, return to the past now.


YUMI: Me thinks that your last words have learned to climb.


ODD: With practice, such gymnastics grow as hard!


YUMI: In truth, I seem to speak from distant heights!


ODD: True, far above at such a height,
toward death if a hard work from you fell upon my heart.


MR. CHARDIN: Stop, stop stop.


It’s not bad, but you’re not there, not just yet.
What you’re missing is a bit more, um…


ULRICH: More passion?


MR. CHARDIN: No no, some…


JIM: Some popcorn?


MR. CHARDIN: No.


MR. DELMAS: Some more funding?


MR. CHARDIN: That would be good, but, uh…


ODD: A touch of insanity?


MR. CHARDIN: Exactly, yes! That’s it!


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)
