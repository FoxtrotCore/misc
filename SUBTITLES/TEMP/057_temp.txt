AELITA: {\i1}But where are we?

FRANZ: {\i1}In my laboratory.
Come on.

AELITA: {\i1}Where?

FRANZ: {\i1}To a world where you and I will be safe.

{\i1}Forever.

{\i1}See you in a minute honey.

AELITA: {\i1}Alright then.

{\i1}Daddy?

{\i1}Daddy where are you?

FRANZ: {\i1}Here I am Aelita.

AELITA: {\i1}Daddy!

FRANZ: {\i1}I can’t materialize myself into human form yet as you can Aelita..

{\i1}I still have more work to do on Lyoko.
This world needs to develop more.

AELITA: {\i1}Daddy there’s some strange looking creatures over there.

FRANZ: {\i1}Run Aelita! Run!

AELITA: {\i1}Daddy!

DEFAULT: Aelita!

AELITA: Huh?

DEFAULT: You know young lady,
most of us go to sleep at night.

AELITA: I’m sorry Mr. Fumet.

DEFAULT:  Scandinavian mythology, a natural disaster brings
about the end of the Norse god’s world.

Scorching the earth, before a new peaceful world can arise from the ashes, called Ragnarok.

ODD: And roll.

DEFAULT: What was that?

ODD: Ragnarok and roll. It was just a joke sir.

DEFAULT: Very funny Della Robbia.

Now would you kindly leave this room?

ODD: Is that a joke?

DEFAULT: No, it’s an order.

ODD: Oh.

I guess as jokes go, is wasn’t really funny.

YUMI: So how was history class?

ULRICH: Who cares it’s history now.

SISSI: Well Ms. Einstein, better get a good night sleep.

A superbrain like yours needs a little shut eye,
and most of us as you know go to sleep at night.

ODD: Of course you don’t have that problem Sissi,
cause your brains are in your feet.

SISSI: Isn’t Odd a riot?
Look who’s got the nerve to talk about my feet.

Especially after what Heidi Kleiner told me about yours.

DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)

ODD: What did she mean with that?
What’s wrong with with my feet?

Huh?

ULRICH: Well, to put it tactfully when you take your shoes off
it’s a little bit like uhh…

JEREMIE: Like a pile of very fresh manure
that we just can’t seem to get away from.

ULRICH: That’s it!

ODD: Oh come on, you’re nuts!

Well, what do you know, there’s Heidi.
Now we’ll find out.

Hey Heidi, is it true my feet smell a little?

DEFAULT: A little? Just make sure you and your sneakers
don’t come within’ 50 feet of me.

(LAUGHTER)

ODD: This is a disaster.

My reputation as a superstar is at stake.
No girl is gonna go out with a…

JEREMIE: A walking pool of toxic waste?

ULRICH: (LAUGHTER)

ODD: Some friend you are Ulrich.

You could’ve said something, you know.
Given me a little hint at least.

ULRICH: It’s hard to talk when you’re holding your nose good buddy.

ODD: I thought you were trying to be funny.

YUMI: Don’t worry Odd, modern medicine must have found some kind of cure for it.

JEREMIE: Well there’s amputation for example.

DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)

ODD: Start without me, be right there!

Emily, could I ask you something?
When we went out together did you notice that uh…

DEFAULT: That your feet smell, better believe it.
Why do you think I kept dousing myself in perfume?

ODD: Yolanda, I’ve got a real problem.
It’s awful, I…

MS. YOLANDA: Yes, yes yes, yes I know.
You suffer from severe plantar perspiration.

ODD: Say what?

MS. YOLANDA: Your feet smell badly Odd.

ODD: Do you mean to say that everyone in school knows?

MS. YOLANDA: No, there’s uh…

Well yes, everyone does know. But don’t worry!
I’ve seen cases that were a lot worse than yours Odd.

What’s more, I know just what to do.

FRANZ: {\i1}Aelita.

AELITA: {\i1}Daddy.

FRANZ: {\i1}Aelita I have to make contact with Xana.
To persuade we can live in peace with him.

AELITA: {\i1}Who’s Xana?

FRANZ: {\i1}A multiagent computer program I created.


It has achieved self-awareness and autonomy. 
And it’s trying to eliminate us now.

AELITA: {\i1}But why daddy?

{\i1}Daddy?

FRANZ: {\i1}Whatever you do, don’t leave this tower.

AELITA: {\i1}Daddy?

{\i1}Daddy!

{\i1}DADDY!

JEREMIE: Aelita?

Hey, what’s the matter?
Is anything wrong?

AELITA: No, I… I was daydreaming I guess.

ODD: Hey guys, no more feet-nightmare.
Call me ”Odorless-Odd”.

ULRICH: How did you manage that?

ODD: You’ll find out tonight. It’s a surprise.

YUMI: Well I’ll let you kick your foot problem around a little,
I’ve got a math test.

AELITA: Jeremie, do you…

Do you think my father is still alive?

JEREMIE: Huh?

AELITA: My father, Franz Hopper.
You think it’s possible to rematerialize him?

JEREMIE: No. What I mean is...
Well, there’s no way to.

AELITA: But he managed to survive when Xana captured him the first time.

Why not a second time?

JEREMIE: Your father sacrificed himself for you Aelita.

And he had to have used what every little strength he had left in him,
to bring you back to life.

AELITA: I know, but…

But I thought there might be a hope,
that maybe you could find a way.

JEREMIE: Impossible, I checked every inch of Lyoko
and there isn’t the slightest sign of him.

Aelita, I’ve been working really hard in a way getting into the world wide web.
So we can fight Xana, and you should think the way I think.

I mean, think about the future.

AELITA: And just forget my past, huh? You think it’s easy?
You didn’t spend Ten years in your life as some sort of computer software.

I wish I never recovered my memory.

AELITA: {\i1}Daddy.

{\i1}Daddy! I’m coming daddy!

{\i1}Daddy!

FRANZ: {\i1}No Aelita! Get back to safety, in the tower!

{\i1}You possess the keys to Lyoko Aelita,
Xana must never get his hands on them. Do you understand?

{\i1}It’s over Aelita, Xana is too powerful.
He’s become a threat to all mankind. I’ve got to shut down the supercomputer.

AELITA: {\i1}But does that mean we’ll die?

FRANZ: {\i1}No, but you mustn’t forget me.
Ever. Never forget Aelita.

AELITA: {\i1}Daddy.

ODD: I knew I’d find you here.

You know, our good buddy Einstein may be good a computer-wiz
but diplomatically he’s… He’s a…

AELITA: A total lameo.

ODD: But he really likes you, you know that.

AELITA: And I really like him too, I just wish he would understand it.
My father is all that I have left in my past life.

Odd, I have to go to Lyoko, to… To Sector Five.
I want to try find some trace of my father.

ODD: But that may not be too easy,
you heard what Jeremie said. He’s not very anxious to help.

AELITA: So we don’t need Jeremie, do we?

ODD: We?

AELITA: Just us. Just you and me, okay Odd?

ODD: Uhh…

JEREMIE: Hey Ulrich, do you think I was a bit too hard on Aelita?

ULRICH: What do you think? It wasn’t easy for her to learn that she was human.
Better talk to her.

JIM: No! You shouldn’t talk to anybody.

There’s no talking permitted in a library.

Anybody I find talking from now on,
is gonna have a little conversation with me.

And if you hadn’t had enough after our little chat,
you can just walk down the hall and have a talk with the principal.

No talking!

JEREMIE: This is awful. Aelita must really hate me, huh?

ULRICH: No she doesn’t. Yeah, but she’s running around
looking for you to make up right now.

YUMI: Hey William, did you study hard?

WILLIAM: Yup, just ask me anything you want
about American history!

YUMI: That’s great, but uh…
The test is in math.


WILLIAM: Uh oh.

AELITA: Okay, I’ll launch the procedure, which’ll automatically
virtualize us in the Desert Sector.

As soon as we materialize, we have one minute to get in sync with the transporter.

ODD: Wow, you know how to do all that?

AELITA: Sure.

Peace of cake.

JEREMIE: Oh no, an activated tower.
In the Mountain Sector.

Okay, we’re out of here.
We can beat Xana if we act fast.

ULRICH: Talk plan?

I’m telling you the recipe calls for eggs, vinegar, 
whipped cream, a little herb and peanut.

JEREMIE: And I say you gotta to use hazelnuts.

ULRICH: You don’t!

JEREMIE: You do!

ULRICH: Oh, we’re not by any chance speaking too loud, are we Jim?

JIM: I want you two out of here immediately.
Now go on, out of my sight, you hear?

ULRICH: That was easy.

JEREMIE: Hey Ulrich, what was that recipe for anyway?
It sounds totally gross.

ULRICH: It’s one of Odd’s concoctions.

YUMI: Hello?

DEFAULT: Are you finished already?

Yumi?

ULRICH: She’s on her way.

JEREMIE: I can’t seem to reach Aelita.

You think she’s still mad at me?

ODD: I hope we didn’t miss our bus.

AELITA: There.

JEREMIE: Hey, do you smell that?
It’s weird, it smells as if Odd has been here.

ULRICH: Forget it Jeremie, Odd hasn’t been here since yesterday.
His feet smell but not 24 hours later.

JEREMIE: Still… It’s bizarre.

AELITA: Let’s go.

JEREMIE: Still nothing from Aelita…

...or Odd.

ULRICH: Forget it, looks as if Odd is angry as well.

JEREMIE: Cause of his smelling feet? That’s dumb.
Odd is losing his sense of humor.

YUMI: I hope this isn’t a false alarm,
I raced through my exam.

JEREMIE: It’s real alright. I’m sending you and Ulrich in right now.
The others will join you just as soon as I can get a hold of them.

Transfer, Yumi.

Transfer, Ulrich.

Virtualization.

ULRICH: Nice one Jeremie.
{\i1}You materialized us in the middle of an airshow.

JEREMIE: Sorry you guys, but more surprises are on the way.
Xana’s called up his heavy artillery.

I’ll materialize your vehicles.

ULRICH: Better hurry.

YUMI: Look, Tarantulas!

ULRICH: Supersprint!


It’s about time.

JEREMIE: Come on Aelita,
you’ve moped long enough, now pick up.

AELITA: Look, the key.
It’s up there!

ODD: This is almost too easy.

AELITA: Energy field!

ODD: Lazer arrow!

AELITA: Bizarre.

You think they were surprised to see us.

ODD: Sorry, we’re not disturbing you, are we?

ULRICH: I see the tower!

YUMI: So do I, but I also see a welcoming committee.

ULRICH: {\i1}Did you get a hold of Odd and Aelita?

JEREMIE: Not a word, I’ll try again. Stay in position for now.
And don’t get devirtualized.

ULRICH: {\i1}We’ll try.

ODD: Aelita! Go!

JEREMIE: Huh?

What is going on around here?
Holosphere system online?

I don’t believe this, they’re already there, traitors!

{\i1}Aelita, Odd, I know you’re there.

For your information, while you’re out there having a ball,
Xana happens to be attacking. Ulrich and Yumi are already on the spot.

ODD: What now Aelita?

AELITA: Let’s go.

JEREMIE: As soon as you get to the Dome, I’ll program a vehicle
and then I’ll open a tunnel. The activated tower is in the Mountain sector.

Now get going!

AELITA: Look Odd!

ODD: They’re not attacking.
It must be a gate.

AELITA: Jeremie, we just spotted some {\i1}flying Manta’s
at the South Pole of the Dome.{\i0} They seem to be guarding the entrance.

JEREMIE: Now that is not a good sign.
Hold on, I’ll check it out.

Uh oh, looks like you were right, Xana’s attacking the core of Lyoko.
{\i1}The tower in the Mountain sector was just a diversion.

ODD: Okay, we’re on it.

ULRICH: Impact!

Your telekinesis thing is really cool.

JEREMIE: {\i1}Ulrich, Yumi,{\i0} change of plans. Listen up.
Odd and Aelita are in Sector Five, you gotta get over there they need some help.

ULRICH: {\i1}What? What’s going on?

JEREMIE: I’ll tell you all about it later but for now, get going.

AELITA: Odd, it’s suicide.

ODD: You’re kidding.

This is a snap, Aelita.

YUMI: Xana really outsmarted us.

While he kept us busy in Mountain sector,
he was free to attack the Core of Lyoko.

JEREMIE: {\i1}Yeah, but he didn’t count on two scanner stoleways
already{\i0} being in Sector Five. Fortunately.

ULRICH: {\i1}So then you’re not mad at them.

JEREMIE: Not a chance.
In fact, as soon as they get here they each get a big kiss.

Are you at the extreme edge of the sector?

ULRICH: {\i1}Sir, yes sir.

JEREMIE: Okay, then I’ll enter the code SCIPIO.

ODD: These guys are tough to get a handle on.

AELITA: You know, you might try throwing one of your shoes at them.

ODD: Very funny, I hit them better than that.

Laser arrow!

AELITA: Odd!

JEREMIE: {\i1}Hurry up, Aelita’s all alone!

And the first shield layer of the core of Lyoko has just given away.

{\i1}Aelita, where are you?

AELITA: In trouble!

Energy field!

JEREMIE: Hang on!
Yumi and Ulrich are on their way.

ULRICH: Supersprint!

Well, did we miss much of the show?

AELITA: No, just the opening act.


ULRICH: My saber!

JEREMIE: Nice one everybody.
Aelita, you know that you still have a tower to deactivate.

{\i1}But if you wanna stop at a terminal first to collect some new data
on Franz Hopper, I mean… If you want to.

AELITA: Yeah, why not?

ULRICH: Okay then, so what’s this miracle cure Yolanda gave you?

ODD: Hold on, I did tell you it was a surprise.
Now close your eyes Ulrich.

ULRICH: I’d rather close my nose, I think.

Ugh, what’s that foul odor?

ODD: It’s the cream. Pretty effective, huh?
Now my feet don’t smell at all.

ULRICH: That’s because the stench of that cream is so horribly strong.
Help, open a window or I’ll die.

ODD: Some guys are never satisfied.

AELITA: Any luck?

JEREMIE: No, nothing.

Hold on a second, what’s that?

AELITA: What have you found?

JEREMIE: A fragment of a DNA code sequence that belongs to Franz Hopper.
You were right Aelita.

AELITA: My father might still be alive somewhere on Lyoko.
