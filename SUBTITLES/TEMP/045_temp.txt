JEREMIE: Huh?

Something is not right here.


What do you mean quack?


An alarm signal, and no activated tower?
That’s weird. 


AELITA: And you’re sure about the alarm last night?


JEREMIE: Not 100%, I was pretty groggy.
Odd, could you make a little less noise?


ODD: No, if I don’t find a DVD of my short film in the next three seconds,
I’ll turn into a pumpkin.


ULRICH: Which short film?
“Natural Granger Two”, or “I Guess Our Guest is a Ghost”?


ODD: I Guess Our Guest is a Ghost.


If you want me to become rich and famous, I absolutely have to give it to TV.


AELITA: TV? Who’s TV?


ODD: His real name is Thomas Vincent


But everybody calls him, TV, 
because he’s the famous news reporter on TV.


TV, get it?


YUMI: TV’s gonna be here in five minutes.


ODD: My career is snipped in the bud.


Hey!
Yes, fame, fortune, and glory are mine.


DELMAS: My dear TV, on behalf of the students and faculty, 
we’re very honored that you--


TV: Ok, ok, no big deal, time is money.


Uh, this is Edna, my camera, uh, woman, person, whatever.
Never on time, show up late one more time, and you’re finished!


I’ve got a hundred and fifty cameramen
who’d kill for a chance to work with TV.


You. Sweatshirt. Park my car out of sight from the kids, I don’t want them scratching it.


JIM: Uh, whoa.


MRS. HERTZ: Now, let’s continue with our study of plant life.


After our field trip last week,
I asked you to calculate the yield of field of corn that we visited.


Now who can give me the answer?
Polyakov?


NICHOLAS: Yeah, one-thousand five-hundred and twenty-seven tonnes.


MRS. HERTZ: Really Nicholas?
Well done, you solved the problem of world hunger.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)


MRZ. HERTS: Quiet down!
Yes?


TV: Give me a panorama shot of the kids.


HERTZ: Ahem, can I help you?


TV: Yes, get out of the shot.


Do our schools still provide a future for our youth?


Faced with the teachers lax attitudes, 
we have reason to doubt.


To see how bad it’s become, all you need to do is pick out a student at random, 
and ask him his grade-point-average.


You for instance.


JEREMIE: 99.87 out of 100.


TV: Huh?


Ok, cut,
that’s too high.


Who here has a below 60 average?


TV: Ok son, so you’re flunking out of school, right?


ODD: Me? Not exactly. On the other hand,
I have this great DVD to show you.


TV: Oh, this cannot be happening, what’s with this--


DEFAULT: (BELL RINGING)
(CHEERING)


ODD: I’m so disgusted, TV didn’t even want to see my masterpiece.


AELITA: Is that what it means to be a starving artist?


JEREMIE: Oh no!


AELITA: What?


JEREMIE: The alarm, Xana’s gone on the attack.


ULRICH: I’ll warn Yumi.


ODD: Well I sure hope this goes quickly,
because I don't want to miss meatballs and gravy.


We haven’t had them for ages.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Virtualization!


Watch it, you've got company!


YUMI: Aelita, stay behind me!


ODD: Everyone bring their insecticide?


AELITA: Yumi!


ULRICH: Supersprint!


ODD: Laser arrow!


Thanks, Yumi.


Hey!


Bunch of chickens!


YUMI: Weird, I guess Xana’s not up to snuff today.


ODD: Well, weird or not it’s better for us because we have waiting for us.


Meatballs and gravy!


JEREMIE: So hurry up!


ODD: Well, my lady, your tower is served.


YUMI: Aelita, wait!


Look!
The tower is deactivating itself.


ULRICH: Well what do ya know?


AELITA: {\i1}What does that mean, Jeremie?


JEREMIE: I wish I knew.


Oh no, another tower activated in the Ice Sector.


Again? Unbelievable.


ODD: What’s going on?


JEREMIE: The tower just deactivated by itself.


I don't get this at all.


AELITA: Do you think it’s a bug in the supercomputer?


ODD: Or a new plot by Xana.


JEREMIE: Go to lunch,
I’ll stay here and try to work all this out.


If anything happens,
I’ll give you a shout.


AELITA: I’ll stay with you, with the two of us, it’ll go faster.


TV: What’s with these little mini-servings,
come on cookie, don’t be shy, load up the meatballs.


Let me tell ya, it sure is no picnic being a field reporter.


ODD: Wait, what. Where are all the meatballs?


ROSA: On TV’s tray. 


TV: Oh this is awful.


SISSI: Any guy who had wheels like this I’d go out with in a heartbeat.


NICHOLAS: Ok, I’m outta here, I’m starving.


AELITA: It’s starting up again!
Should I tell the others?


JEREMIE: Hang on, it might deactivate by itself again.


ULRICH: Look, it’s snowing!


DEFAULT: (CHEERING)


JIM: Calm down everyone,
stay in your seats.


JEREMIE: The sub-system seems ok too.


AELITA: Jeremie, the tower is still activated.


JEREMIE: Uh oh, bad news.
Maybe this time Xana really is attacking.


JIM: That’s enough now,
everyone inside!


YUMI: Yes, Jeremie?


Xana’s attacking.


DEFAULT: (WIND BLOWING)


JIM: Inside, on the double!


Come on, I gotcha.


YUMI: We have to get to Lyoko.


ODD: Yeah, you’re right, and I bet the weather is better there.


YUMI: {\i1}Jeremie? We’re stuck at school because of the blizzard.


JEREMIE: What a nightmare, Xana’s back to his old self.


HERB: Closed, now what?


SISSI: Follow me.


Cool, the Subsonics.


JIM: Here, Mr. TV this’ll keep your hair in place.


EDNA: (GIGGLING)


DELMAS: Very good, Mrs. Hertz.
You did well to take the children safely to the basement of the science building.


JIM: Look Mr Delmas, I found the weather station,
I got this free with my Sumo-Mag-Subscription.


Up there it shows the temperature outside, it’s uh four degrees below zero.


And down here it shows the temperature in here, thirty-seven.


DELMAS: Thirty-seven degrees?
Come on, let’s go down to the boiler room.


JIM: Ok everybody.


HERB: It’s a scientific fact that if we huddle together we’ll keep warmer.


DEFAULT: (SMACK)


HERB: Ouch!


Sissi: It’s a scientific fact that a good slap will keep your cheek warm.

DELMAS: I’m setting it on maximum. That should warm us up a little. 


TV: Edna. stop wasting film. 


An unbelievable deep-freeze  has taken hold of the city,
and what are you shooting? Three brats in a basement! 


It’s not even PG-13!
People expect spectacular TV from TV.


So let’s get out of this rathole,
and go where the action is , the city!


EDNA: Not with me. 


TV: Oh yeah? Fine.
You’re fired!


DEFAULT: (CONFUSION)


TV: Can’t have cold feet on this job.


JIM: You can’t go outside,
it’s forty below out there.


TV: My car keys?


JIM: Oh.


I, um, I think I left them in the ignition--


TV: Idiot!


ULRICH: Did you hear that?
Forty below, and there’s no reason for Xana to stop there.


ODD: The only solution is to deactivate the tower on Lyoko.
But if we go out, we’ll end up as ice sculptures.


YUMI: We’ll have to try. 

We’ll sneak out of here and search the rooms for warmer gear.
And then run over to the factory.


ODD: Ok.


SISSI: I’m warning you, Herb. If you fall asleep, I’ll slap you again!


TV: What do you think you;re doing in my car? Get out of here!


SISSI: Hey, you;re not going to leave us in this blizzard, are you?


TV: Fine, I’ll drop you off. Get in the back, and don't get my soft leather seats dirty, got it?


Stupid power steering.


DEFAULT: (LOUD CRASH)


ULRICH: Did you see that?


YUMI: We’ve gotta go and help them.


JIM: Yes, Michael? 


MICHAEL: How c-cold is it?


JIM: F-fifty-eight degrees below zero outside.
Twenty-three degrees in here.


DEFAULT --Has hit the city, which buried under ice and snow in a matter of minutes.


The authorities have put and emergency cold weather alert into action.
But chaos has broken out nonetheless--


TV: I-it wasn’t my fault, it was the p-p-power steering, I--


YUMI: Yeah right, why don’t you make yourself useful, in the meantime,
and get Sissi and Herb into the boiler room, fast! 


ODD: Now that’s authority.


YUMI: Ulrich! Look out!


DEFAULT: (SCREAMING)


ODD: That was close.


ULRICH: Yumi!


YUMI: This is why… I like bonsais better... 


ULRICH: We’ll get you outta there.


One, two, three.


YUMI: Forget it, it’s much too heavy.
Go to the factory, that’s more important.


ODD: We can’t just leave her here.
She won’t last long in this cold.


ULRICH: Ok, you get to Lyoko,
I’ll stay here with her.


ODD: Good luck.


ULRICH: Hang in there, I’m going to go and look for something to get you outta there.


YUMI: Yes.


AELITA: We have no choice, Jeremie.


JEREMIE: But that’s exactly what Xana’s waiting for, Aelita.
For you to go to Lyoko alone, so he can steal your memory.


AELITA: If someone doesn’t go and deactivate that tower, Ulrich, Yumi, and Odd will die of cold, and the entire city with them.


JEREMIE: Yeah, I guess you're right.,
I’ll launch the virtualization process.


ULRICH: Yumi!


YUMI: Let. Me Sleep.


ULRICH: No. No, You can sleep later, ok?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Look out, Aelita, hornets on the way!


AELITA: I can’t see anything for now.


They’re not hornets, they’re flying mantas!


JEREMIE: Huh? But they never leave Sector Five.


AELITA: We have to face facts. Xana is getting more and more powerful.


JEREMIE: {\i1}About face, Aelita, fast!


JIM: well, that’s it.


ODD: Think about warm things, Odd.


Tahiti, uh, sauna, heat wave, fireplace.


AELITA: Flying mines!


ULRICH: Yumi, stay with me.


JIM: Ok, no sleeping. Everyone listen up,
I’m gonna tell you a little story. 


It’s from when I was a volunteer research subject for the space exploration program.


JEREMIE: Aelita, what are you doing? You’re going straight into the Scyphozoa.


ODD: Hot springs, blast furnace.


JIM: And b-believe it or not, Major Santanos really had--


DEFAULT: (SMACK)


EDNA: No sleeping!


DEFAULT: (SHIVERING)


JEREMIE: Aelita, behind you!


ULRICH: Please, hang on. I’m sure Odd’s already on Lyoko.


ODD: Magma.


JEREMIE: Odd!


Transfer Odd.


Virtualization!


ODD: Oh no, more ice.


YUMI: Leave me.


ULRICH: You won’t get rid of me that easily.


ODD: Laser arrow!


Can I drop you off at the next tower, perhaps?


AELITA: I wouldn’t say no.


JERMIE: {\i1}Look out behind you!


JIM: And so there I--


JEREMIE: {\i1}Another field of flying mines!


ODD: Hang on!


ULRICH: Please... Yumi… Don’t give up…
We need you, to fight against Xana... 


AELITA: Odd, the flying mantas are behind us!

ODD: Haha, right where I want them.


Here we go.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Yes! There’s an open passage!


ODD: Hurry. I’ll cover you. 


Shield!


(SCREAMING)


DEFAULT: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)


ULRICH: I need you.


DEFAULT: (HUMMING CONTINUES)


AELITA: Tower deactivated.


ULRICH: Yumi?
Yumi!


Oh no! No!


ODD: Jeremie, hurry up, launch a return to the past,
Yumi is in trouble!


JEREMIE: Ok.
Return to the past, now!


TV: What’s with these mini-servings? Come on, cookie, don’t be shy, load up the meatballs. 


ROSA: Do you really want it?


TV: Oh yeah. What are you, deaf too?
