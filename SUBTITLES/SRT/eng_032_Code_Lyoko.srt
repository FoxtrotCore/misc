0:20:46,200 --> 0:20:47,820
XANA wants her memory.

355
0:20:47,820 --> 0:20:49,440
He won’t risk losing that.

356
0:20:49,440 --> 0:20:52,720
Deep down, he wants her alive
as much as we do.

357
0:20:52,720 --> 0:20:54,40
Are you sure?

358
0:20:54,40 --> 0:20:57,0
No. But I can’t think of anything else.

359
0:20:57,540 --> 0:20:59,700
Okay. Here I go.

360
0:21:3,60 --> 0:21:4,980
(BEEPS)

361
0:21:4,980 --> 0:21:6,980
<i>Only 30 life points left!</i>

362
0:21:6,980 --> 0:21:8,320
Well, you want me to stop?

363
0:21:8,900 --> 0:21:9,640
<i>No!</i>

364
0:21:9,640 --> 0:21:11,440
I just hope I’m right.

365
0:21:12,440 --> 0:21:15,150
(GROANS)

366
0:21:15,150 --> 0:21:16,750
XANA’s givin’ up!

367
0:21:18,800 --> 0:21:19,950
Yes!

368
0:21:22,420 --> 0:21:24,400
Uh-oh. The scyphozoa’s at it again.

369
0:21:24,400 --> 0:21:26,80
It was too good to be true.

370
0:21:29,350 --> 0:21:31,550
Only 10 life points left!

371
0:21:35,130 --> 0:21:36,480
It’s okay!

372
0:21:41,730 --> 0:21:43,40
What’s going on?

373
0:21:43,40 --> 0:21:45,80
Why are you aiming at me?

374
0:22:19,350 --> 0:22:21,40
Tower deactivated.

375
0:22:31,660 --> 0:22:32,930
I’m gonna study this.

376
0:22:32,930 --> 0:22:34,220
You never know.
I might be able to get

377
0:22:34,220 --> 0:22:36,150
some interesting
information about XANA.

378
0:22:36,150 --> 0:22:38,600
Anyway, Aelita, from now on,

379
0:22:38,600 --> 0:22:41,0
you don’t take any presents from anyone.

380
0:22:41,0 --> 0:22:41,950
Promise.

381
0:22:41,950 --> 0:22:43,710
You know, Jeremie saved my life,

382
0:22:43,710 --> 0:22:46,950
And that’s the nicest Valentine’s
present anyone can hope for.

383
0:22:46,950 --> 0:22:49,370
Yeah, but that sure won’t save him
from being suspended

384
0:22:49,370 --> 0:22:51,130
for missing four hours of detention.

385
0:22:51,130 --> 0:22:53,950
The principal’s not gonna be
too happy about that!

386
0:22:53,950 --> 0:22:56,310
But I’m sure there’s a solution!

387
0:22:56,930 --> 0:22:59,0
Hey, what are you looking at me for?

388
0:22:59,370 --> 0:23:1,880
I’m really happy to be going
to the concert with you,

389
0:23:1,880 --> 0:23:4,680
but you won’t forget to talk to
your father beforehand, huh?

390
0:23:4,680 --> 0:23:7,60
Don’t worry. I’ll get Jeremie out of this.

391
0:23:8,480 --> 0:23:9,950
Now that’s a real friend.

392
0:23:9,950 --> 0:23:11,970
Ready to sacrifice himself for his pal.

393
0:23:11,970 --> 0:23:15,130
Are you sure he’s sacrificing himself
as much as all that?

394
0:23:15,130 --> 0:23:17,150
He doesn’t seem to be bothered by it.

395
0:23:17,150 --> 0:23:18,350
Maybe not.

396
0:23:18,350 --> 0:23:20,800
But it was for me that he wrote the poem.

397
0:23:20,800 --> 0:23:21,910
Poor Sissi!

398
0:23:21,910 --> 0:23:22,770
(LAUGHTER)
