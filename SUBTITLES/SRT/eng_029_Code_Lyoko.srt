Aren’t you guys startin'
to get sick of all this?

18
0:1:9,240 --> 0:1:10,0
No.

19
0:1:9,240 --> 0:1:10,0
No.

20
0:1:10,0 --> 0:1:13,80
Well, sometimes I really wish
we were done with XANA.

21
0:1:13,80 --> 0:1:14,850
Uh, you missed an episode, Ulrich.

22
0:1:14,850 --> 0:1:16,850
Remember, Aelita's
carrying a miserable virus

23
0:1:16,850 --> 0:1:18,360
that links her to her old friend XANA.

24
0:1:18,360 --> 0:1:20,750
Bye-bye XANA means bye-bye Aelita.

25
0:1:20,750 --> 0:1:23,70
And I don’t know how to
create an anti-virus.

26
0:1:23,70 --> 0:1:24,520
I mean, not just yet.

27
0:1:24,520 --> 0:1:26,470
Hey, I have an idea!

28
0:1:26,470 --> 0:1:29,570
Why don't we explore the new
mysterious sector we discovered?

29
0:1:29,570 --> 0:1:30,680
Sector five?

30
0:1:30,680 --> 0:1:31,870
But we don’t know what’s in it!

31
0:1:31,870 --> 0:1:33,20
Sure we do!

32
0:1:33,20 --> 0:1:35,710
There are monsters,
ultra-dangerous traps,

33
0:1:35,710 --> 0:1:38,330
and a scyphozoa, as you call it,
that wants to steal Aelita’s memory.

34
0:1:38,330 --> 0:1:40,870
You’re right, but what if
there's something else there?

35
0:1:40,870 --> 0:1:43,80
Like information about XANA?

36
0:1:43,80 --> 0:1:44,500
We <i>have</i> to go back.

37
0:1:44,500 --> 0:1:45,370
Good idea.

38
0:1:45,370 --> 0:1:46,710
All three of us will go.

39
0:1:46,710 --> 0:1:48,120
You mean all <i>four</i> of us.

40
0:1:48,120 --> 0:1:49,840
I want to be part of this expedition.

41
0:1:49,840 --> 0:1:52,30
With that scyphozoa slinking around?

42
0:1:52,30 --> 0:1:53,240
No way.

43
0:1:53,240 --> 0:1:54,820
What if there’s a tower to deactivate?

44
0:1:54,820 --> 0:1:56,0
Think about it!

45
0:1:56,0 --> 0:1:57,710
I <i>have</i> to be there.

46
0:1:57,710 --> 0:1:59,250
Come on, Einstein!

47
0:1:59,250 --> 0:2:2,100
With bodyguards like us,
she has nothing to worry about!

48
0:2:2,100 --> 0:2:3,640
And I promise to be careful!

49
0:2:3,640 --> 0:2:4,280
Okay.

50
0:2:4,280 --> 0:2:6,210
Tomorrow night, exploration.

Oh my gosh! It’s so late!

52
0:2:9,620 --> 0:2:11,700
My parents must be
going bananas!

0:2:11,700 --> 0:2:13,430
Bye! See you tomorrow!

54
0:2:14,0 --> 0:2:16,280
And as for us, we missed dinner again.

55
0:2:16,280 --> 0:2:18,920
And when I think it was
spaghetti and meatballs!

56
0:2:37,140 --> 0:2:39,940
Yumi, we need to talk.

57
0:2:39,940 --> 0:2:42,70
You come home late
every single night.

58
0:2:42,70 --> 0:2:43,420
Tonight is the last straw.

59
0:2:43,420 --> 0:2:44,580
It’s past 10 o’clock

60
0:2:44,580 --> 0:2:46,230
and you didn't even bother
to telephone us.

61
0:2:46,230 --> 0:2:48,170
And you haven’t eaten anything, either.

62
0:2:48,170 --> 0:2:49,410
What’s going on, dear?

63
0:2:49,410 --> 0:2:51,960
If you have a problem,
you know you can tell us.

64
0:2:52,360 --> 0:2:54,530
No, really. Everything’s fine.

65
0:2:54,530 --> 0:2:56,600
I was studying math at Maïtena’s house.

66
0:2:56,600 --> 0:2:57,480
I told you already.

67
0:2:57,480 --> 0:2:58,880
Maïtena Lecuyer?

68
0:2:58,880 --> 0:2:59,860
Uh-huh.

69
0:2:59,860 --> 0:3:1,380
Hmm. That’s strange.

70
0:3:1,380 --> 0:3:3,490
When I called her, she was studying.

71
0:3:3,490 --> 0:3:4,700
By herself.

72
0:3:4,700 --> 0:3:7,110
You’re lying to us, Yumi.
That’s not like you.

73
0:3:7,110 --> 0:3:8,310
What’s the matter with you?

74
0:3:8,310 --> 0:3:10,520
I worry about you, sweetheart.

75
0:3:10,520 --> 0:3:11,960
Tell me what’s bothering you.

76
0:3:11,960 --> 0:3:14,290
I promise you that
everything's just fine.

77
0:3:14,290 --> 0:3:15,980
You saw my last report card.

78
0:3:15,980 --> 0:3:18,850
It was great, so why worry about me?

We’re going to have to
get a lot more strict.

It’s nice of you to come with me,

83
0:3:41,960 --> 0:3:44,440
but I’m big enough to go
to school alone. Really, I am.

84
0:3:44,440 --> 0:3:45,680
You are, huh?

85
0:3:45,680 --> 0:3:48,340
If you were, then you’d stop lying to us

86
0:3:48,340 --> 0:3:50,460
and tell us why you come
home so late all the time.

87
0:3:50,460 --> 0:3:53,160
Are you gonna watch me
24 hours a day? Is that it?

88
0:3:53,160 --> 0:3:54,670
Am I in prison or something?

89
0:3:54,670 --> 0:3:57,470
We’re trying to understand you
and to protect you, too.

Oh, wow!

91
0:4:3,950 --> 0:4:5,880
I bet that you’ll be
picking me up as well, huh?

92
0:4:5,880 --> 0:4:7,960
I'll be waiting for you
here at 5 o'clock.

93
0:4:7,960 --> 0:4:9,690
I advise you not to be late.

Oh, what a mess.

98
0:4:19,170 --> 0:4:21,100
The worst thing is
I hate lying to them.

99
0:4:21,400 --> 0:4:24,80
Just explain to them that
we’re fighting in a virtual universe

100
0:4:24,80 --> 0:4:26,270
against a demonic
artificial intelligence.

101
0:4:26,270 --> 0:4:27,760

You’ve got to win back
their trust in you.

stay away from Lyoko for a little while.

I know you’re all dying to go

113
0:4:47,90 --> 0:4:48,960

Of course I did! Listen.

Right. Meaning the

157
0:7:53,480 --> 0:7:55,880
You’ve got to find a
way to deactivate it.

158
0:7:55,880 --> 0:7:58,480
That must be the answer
to exploring further.

0:8:9,680 --> 0:8:11,40

You know what'll happen if Aelita
loses her life points, don't you!

Don’t worry.

That’s a great help
for finding our way around.

170
0:8:44,600 --> 0:8:47,340
If we knew everything,
we wouldn’t be exploring.

171
0:8:47,340 --> 0:8:49,360

0:9:57,120 --> 0:9:59,410
Wow, 40 life points in one go!

182
0:9:59,410 --> 0:10:1,810
Those creepers sure are powerful!

183
0:10:6,370 --> 0:10:7,640
They’re powerful!

184
0:10:7,640 --> 0:10:9,90
And really ugly, too!

185
0:10:9,90 --> 0:10:11,10
Jeremie, any ideas?

186
0:10:11,10 --> 0:10:12,800
No, but I got news for you.

187
0:10:12,800 --> 0:10:13,940
You’re in a labyrinth.

188
0:10:13,940 --> 0:10:16,440
<i>Make a left at each fork,
and leave a mark there.</i>

189
0:10:16,440 --> 0:10:19,10
If the way is already marked,
then make a right.

190
0:10:19,460 --> 0:10:20,760
This is incredible!

191
0:10:20,760 --> 0:10:22,600
We’ll never get out of this thing!

192
0:10:23,240 --> 0:10:24,120
<i>You’d better!</i>

193
0:10:24,120 --> 0:10:27,0
<i>Just two minutes left to find
a way to stop the countdown!</i>

194
0:10:30,880 --> 0:10:33,460
We’re out, Jeremie! We made it!

195
0:10:33,460 --> 0:10:36,370
Nothing like having
a little luck on your side.

196
0:10:36,370 --> 0:10:39,30
<i>Hey, Einstein, why
complicate things, huh?</i>

197
0:10:45,920 --> 0:10:48,200
Ah, great. Now what do we do?

198
0:10:48,200 --> 0:10:49,890
Jeremie, can you see
anything from your end?

199
0:10:49,890 --> 0:10:51,520
So, you need me again, huh?

200
0:10:56,420 --> 0:10:57,640
Go back to where you were.

201
0:10:57,640 --> 0:10:59,240
I spotted a mechanism on the wall.

202
0:10:59,240 --> 0:11:1,60
Hurry! Time's running out!

203
0:11:4,660 --> 0:11:5,350
There!

204
0:11:5,350 --> 0:11:6,840
Let me at it!

205
0:11:14,840 --> 0:11:17,960
<i>Fourteen! Thirteen! Twelve!</i>

206
0:11:17,960 --> 0:11:21,280
<i>Eleven! Ten! Nine!</i>

207
0:11:21,280 --> 0:11:23,910
<i>Eight! Seven! Six!</i>

208
0:11:23,910 --> 0:11:24,970
<i>Five! Four!</i>

209
0:11:24,970 --> 0:11:26,340
Agh!

210
0:11:26,340 --> 0:11:27,730
No!

211
0:11:31,440 --> 0:11:32,180
Agh!

212
0:11:32,180 --> 0:11:33,350
Ulrich!

213
0:11:37,300 --> 0:11:39,240
Aelita, the countdown is over.

214
0:11:39,240 --> 0:11:40,960
The room is bound to change now.

215
0:11:44,480 --> 0:11:45,640
<i>You okay?</i>

216
0:11:45,640 --> 0:11:48,710
Well, no more creepers. That’s a start.

217
0:11:48,710 --> 0:11:49,560
Don’t worry.

218
0:11:49,560 --> 0:11:52,790
I’ll rematerialize Odd and Ulrich,
and I’ll get you out of there.

219
0:11:52,790 --> 0:11:54,790
Come on, come on!

220
0:11:54,790 --> 0:11:57,170
(BEEPS)

221
0:12:3,720 --> 0:12:5,60
Oh, no!

222
0:12:5,60 --> 0:12:7,620
<i>Aelita, Odd and Ulrich
didn’t come back!</i>

223
0:12:7,620 --> 0:12:8,610
What?

224
0:12:8,610 --> 0:12:12,130
<i>But that’s impossible. Are they lost?</i>

225
0:12:12,130 --> 0:12:13,960
For the moment, they are.

226
0:12:13,960 --> 0:12:16,930
So there’s no rematerialization
from sector five?

227
0:12:16,930 --> 0:12:18,40
<i>Sure there is.</i>

228
0:12:18,40 --> 0:12:19,940
<i>Once we find the right program.</i>

229
0:12:19,940 --> 0:12:21,830
And do you think you can find it?

230
0:12:21,830 --> 0:12:24,980
It’s probably as easy as
finding your antivirus.

231
0:12:24,980 --> 0:12:27,410
But don’t worry.
I'm gonna do the impossible.

232
0:12:39,830 --> 0:12:42,790
Hiroki, could you make
some <i>more</i> noise, please?

233
0:12:42,790 --> 0:12:45,160
Sorry, Yumi. The volume's
as high as it goes.

234
0:12:45,160 --> 0:12:46,210
Hiroki.

235
0:12:46,980 --> 0:12:49,670
Go into the other room, Hiroki.
Go on now.

236
0:12:55,760 --> 0:12:57,650
I pass.

237
0:12:58,920 --> 0:13:0,710
Me, too. I pass.

238
0:13:0,710 --> 0:13:2,530
Then the game is over!
(LAUGHS)

239
0:13:2,530 --> 0:13:4,690
I have five points more than you!

240
0:13:4,690 --> 0:13:6,130
On the Goban, yes.

241
0:13:6,130 --> 0:13:8,180
Don’t forget that I played the whites.

242
0:13:8,180 --> 0:13:10,370
With Komi, I win by half a point.

243
0:13:10,370 --> 0:13:11,270
Oh.

244
0:13:12,560 --> 0:13:13,910
(YAWNS)

245
0:13:13,910 --> 0:13:16,230
Well, it’s bed time.

246
0:13:16,230 --> 0:13:17,430
Goodnight.

247
0:13:18,450 --> 0:13:20,450
Goodnight, my dear.

248
0:13:22,880 --> 0:13:25,80
<i>Jeremie, how’s it going?</i>

249
0:13:25,80 --> 0:13:27,400
Badly. Head for the factory.

250
0:13:29,110 --> 0:13:30,480
Jeremie?

251
0:13:30,480 --> 0:13:31,620
Can you hear that?

252
0:13:34,420 --> 0:13:36,160
It’s the scyphozoa!

253
0:13:36,160 --> 0:13:37,750
It’s heading towards you!

254
0:13:37,750 --> 0:13:39,630
Stay calm. Yumi’s coming.

255
0:13:39,630 --> 0:13:41,280
(SCREECHING)

256
0:13:41,280 --> 0:13:43,410
Yumi, can I come in?

257
0:13:43,410 --> 0:13:45,150
I want to talk to you for a minute.

258
0:13:52,580 --> 0:13:53,330
Huh?

259
0:13:55,600 --> 0:13:56,570
Yumi?

260
0:14:4,40 --> 0:14:5,750
Jeremie, I’m in the elevator.

261
0:14:5,750 --> 0:14:8,150
You have to get Aelita in sector five!

262
0:14:8,150 --> 0:14:9,460
The Scyphozoa is there!

263
0:14:9,460 --> 0:14:10,730
<i>What about Odd and Ulrich?</i>

264
0:14:10,730 --> 0:14:12,150
You want the best case scenario?

265
0:14:12,150 --> 0:14:13,10
<i>I’d rather.</i>

266
0:14:13,10 --> 0:14:15,700
I’ve got about a one in a million
chance of finding the right code

267
0:14:15,700 --> 0:14:16,950
to bring them back.

268
0:14:20,230 --> 0:14:21,800
(YAWNS)

269
0:14:22,270 --> 0:14:25,630
So sorry to bother you at such
a late hour, Headmaster Delmas,

270
0:14:25,630 --> 0:14:27,320
but we’re very worried.

271
0:14:27,320 --> 0:14:29,670
Yes, yes. I understand.
But it’s quite possible

272
0:14:29,670 --> 0:14:31,770
that Yumi is somewhere on the campus.

273
0:14:31,770 --> 0:14:32,550
Why, sure!

274
0:14:32,550 --> 0:14:34,890
She’s probably hanging out
with her little gang of friends.

275
0:14:34,890 --> 0:14:35,700
Come on.

276
0:14:42,50 --> 0:14:44,230
You’re on the edge of the territory, Yumi.

277
0:14:44,580 --> 0:14:45,630
Better be careful.

278
0:14:45,630 --> 0:14:48,680
XANA’s going to do all that he can
to keep you from taking the transporter.

279
0:14:54,650 --> 0:14:57,420
Jeremie! Enter…the code!

280
0:15:6,270 --> 0:15:7,500
Yumi?

281
0:15:8,540 --> 0:15:10,440
Huh. No one’s here.

282
0:15:10,700 --> 0:15:12,680
No one’s in Stern’s room either.

283
0:15:12,680 --> 0:15:14,180
Looking for someone?

284
0:15:15,150 --> 0:15:17,400
Uh, Sissi. Would you
know where your friends

285
0:15:17,400 --> 0:15:20,120
Stern, Belpois, and
Della Robbia might be?

286
0:15:20,120 --> 0:15:22,640
Probably up to no good. As usual.

287
0:15:22,640 --> 0:15:23,610
But I don’t know where.

288
0:15:23,610 --> 0:15:26,790
Although, their little mascot
can find them for you.

289
0:15:26,790 --> 0:15:29,740
Mascot? What mascot?

290
0:15:33,750 --> 0:15:35,260
Tada!

291
0:15:35,260 --> 0:15:37,340
A flea-bitten mangy mutt!

292
0:15:37,340 --> 0:15:40,200
Huh. Well, excuse me, Mr. Delmas.

293
0:15:40,200 --> 0:15:42,460
Ew. Hey, little puppy.

294
0:15:42,460 --> 0:15:43,970
Where’s your master, huh?

295
0:15:44,430 --> 0:15:45,880
Go get him!

296
0:15:46,890 --> 0:15:48,320
(YAPS)

297
0:15:48,460 --> 0:15:49,700
Let’s follow him!

298
0:15:53,670 --> 0:15:54,780
Hang in there, Aelita.

299
0:15:54,780 --> 0:15:55,920
Yumi’s on the way.

300
0:15:55,920 --> 0:15:57,390
I hope so.

301
0:15:59,850 --> 0:16:1,320
Yumi? Can you hear me?

302
0:16:1,320 --> 0:16:3,390
<i>Yes. I’m in the arena.</i>

303
0:16:3,390 --> 0:16:5,480
The transporter got to me just in time.

304
0:16:5,480 --> 0:16:6,820
Horrible Kankrelat.

305
0:16:8,870 --> 0:16:9,990
<i>Listen up, now.</i>

306
0:16:9,990 --> 0:16:12,460
<i>You have to get to the corridor
and trigger the mechanism</i>

307
0:16:12,460 --> 0:16:14,730
<i>before the countdown runs out, okay?</i>

308
0:16:14,730 --> 0:16:15,900
Okay.

309
0:16:15,900 --> 0:16:18,150
If I’m right about how
the core zone functions,

310
0:16:18,150 --> 0:16:19,500
my plan should work.

311
0:16:23,40 --> 0:16:25,910
Huh. What’s the matter with that hound?

312
0:16:26,520 --> 0:16:28,430
Oh, I don’t believe it!

313
0:16:29,80 --> 0:16:32,30
This reminds me of when I
used to work in the sewers.

314
0:16:32,770 --> 0:16:34,690
You, uh, used to work in the sewers, Jim?

315
0:16:34,690 --> 0:16:36,740
I, uh…I’d rather not talk about it.

316
0:16:42,30 --> 0:16:43,820
<i>Only two minutes left, Yumi!</i>

317
0:16:55,240 --> 0:16:56,700
Down to 10 points, Yumi!

318
0:16:56,700 --> 0:16:58,320
<i>This is not the time to mess up!</i>

319
0:0:1,0 --> 0:0:1,0
That’s weird.

320
0:17:8,280 --> 0:17:9,730
(BARKS

321

322
0:17:13,350 --> 0:17:15,240
Jim, we’re wasting time!

323
0:17:15,750 --> 0:17:18,180
Will you let go of that slipper! You flea-bitten--

324
0:17:18,180 --> 0:17:19,830
Come on! Let go of it!

325
0:17:33,40 --> 0:17:35,280
Yumi, this is no time to drag your feet.

326
0:17:37,640 --> 0:17:39,830
<i>I’ve located the mechanism.
It’s on your right.</i>

327
0:17:39,830 --> 0:17:41,430
<i>You have ten seconds!</i>

328
0:17:47,380 --> 0:17:48,650
<i>Two seconds!</i>

329
0:17:51,780 --> 0:17:53,210
It works, Jeremie!

330
0:17:53,210 --> 0:17:55,640
<i>The whole zone is being reconfigured!</i>

331
0:18:0,60 --> 0:18:0,910
<i>We did it!</i>

332
0:18:0,910 --> 0:18:3,60
<i>Aelita, take the access behind you!</i>

333
0:18:8,30 --> 0:18:9,20
Huh?

334
0:18:11,690 --> 0:18:12,520
Wow!

335
0:18:12,520 --> 0:18:14,60
It’s some kind of elevator!

<i>You know what we do
with elevators, right?</i>

337
0:18:19,930 --> 0:18:21,400
We ride 'em!

<i>Try to grab Aelita as you go by!</i>

Where are you taking me?

341
0:18:45,390 --> 0:18:46,710
I have no idea.

342
0:19:10,800 --> 0:19:11,980
There’s an interface!

343
0:19:12,660 --> 0:19:13,720
I can get in.

344
0:19:15,420 --> 0:19:16,340
Incredible!

345
0:19:16,620 --> 0:19:17,220
What?

346
0:19:17,220 --> 0:19:18,310
<i>It’s unbelieveable.</i>

347
0:19:18,310 --> 0:19:20,420
<i>The interface gives access…</i>

348
0:19:20,420 --> 0:19:21,650
to XANA’s own data!

349
0:19:21,650 --> 0:19:22,620
Huh?

350
0:19:23,50 --> 0:19:26,220
Sector five is where XANA lives!

351
0:19:27,350 --> 0:19:29,480
XANA’s not a very good housekeeper.

352
0:19:29,780 --> 0:19:32,380
There’s some weird things
hanging around this place.

353
0:19:32,760 --> 0:19:35,650
I’ve got access to all kinds of data. It’s crazy!

354
0:19:35,990 --> 0:19:38,870
<i>Look for the specific
devirtualization code for sector five.</i>

355
0:19:38,870 --> 0:19:41,250
<i>If you find it, we can
rescue Odd and Ulrich!</i>

356
0:19:58,760 --> 0:20:0,640
Jeremie, I’m gonna need the Overwing.

357
0:20:0,640 --> 0:20:2,290
Uh-oh. Bad news.

358
0:20:3,400 --> 0:20:7,60
When Aelita’s working on the interface,
I can’t do anything from my end.

359
0:20:9,130 --> 0:20:11,610
I think I found it. I’m transmitting it to you.

360
0:20:11,610 --> 0:20:13,840
Okay. I’m taking over again now.

361
0:20:16,210 --> 0:20:18,340
What would a nice girl like Yumi doing here?

362
0:20:18,340 --> 0:20:19,460
Where are we, anyway?

363
0:20:23,300 --> 0:20:24,860
Jeremie, the Overwing! Now!

364
0:20:25,390 --> 0:20:26,480
<i>It’s on the way!</i>

365
0:20:31,410 --> 0:20:33,30
How do we get out of here?

366
0:20:33,30 --> 0:20:34,310
There are some tunnels.

367
0:20:35,80 --> 0:20:36,230
They’re closed!

368
0:20:36,550 --> 0:20:37,720
<i>Lets see.</i>

369
0:20:39,30 --> 0:20:40,170
Tunnels…

370
0:20:40,170 --> 0:20:40,930
What if…

371
0:20:40,930 --> 0:20:43,780
What if they corresponded to those
that open onto the arena?

372
0:20:47,730 --> 0:20:49,350
Yippie! It works!

373
0:20:54,840 --> 0:20:56,500
Nice one, Einstein!

374
0:21:3,690 --> 0:21:5,0
Yumi!

375
0:21:11,380 --> 0:21:13,930
Jeremie, I got out through a way tower!

376
0:21:13,930 --> 0:21:16,280
<i>Okay. Now get to a neutral tower.
I’ll bring you in!</i>

377
0:21:18,90 --> 0:21:19,670
Okay. I’m ready, Aelita.

378
0:21:19,670 --> 0:21:21,890
<i>Code: Earth.</i>

379
0:21:26,360 --> 0:21:28,480
It's okay, Jeremie. I’m here.

380
0:21:28,960 --> 0:21:30,280
But what about the others?

381
0:21:30,280 --> 0:21:31,730
<i>I’m entering the new code!</i>

382
0:21:32,150 --> 0:21:33,880
Materialization Yumi!

383
0:21:33,880 --> 0:21:35,520
Materialization Odd!

384
0:21:35,520 --> 0:21:37,460
Materialization Ulrich!

385
0:21:38,40 --> 0:21:40,20
Now all we can do is hope.

386
0:21:54,90 --> 0:21:55,490
Yeah!

387
0:21:55,490 --> 0:21:56,620
We did it!

388
0:21:56,620 --> 0:21:57,980
Odd!

389
0:21:57,980 --> 0:22:0,120
How you feel? Say something!

390
0:22:0,540 --> 0:22:1,820
Something!

391
0:22:8,570 --> 0:22:9,390
Kiwi!

392
0:22:9,390 --> 0:22:11,350
Yumi? What are you doing here?

393
0:22:11,350 --> 0:22:13,980
I believe you all have
some explaining to do.

394
0:22:17,360 --> 0:22:18,190
Hey!

395
0:22:19,480 --> 0:22:20,300
Ah ha!

396
0:22:21,10 --> 0:22:22,930
Trying to outsmart me, huh?

397
0:22:27,690 --> 0:22:28,610
What the…

398
0:22:28,610 --> 0:22:29,880
Belpois!

399
0:22:29,880 --> 0:22:31,200
W-What?

400
0:22:31,200 --> 0:22:32,450
What is this place?

401
0:22:32,450 --> 0:22:33,740
Nothing rings a bell, Jim?

402
0:22:33,740 --> 0:22:35,50
Funny 'cause you’ve
been here before.

403
0:22:35,50 --> 0:22:36,870
What are you talking about?
I don’t remember this!

404
0:22:36,870 --> 0:22:38,170
Well, yes and no.

405
0:22:38,170 --> 0:22:39,80
Huh?

406
0:22:39,80 --> 0:22:41,430
Return to the past now.

407
0:22:51,20 --> 0:22:54,290
So, then. You still refuse
to give us an explanation?

408
0:22:54,290 --> 0:22:56,320
Alright, I’ll tell you.

409
0:22:56,320 --> 0:22:57,820
I’m in love.

410
0:22:59,190 --> 0:23:2,10
Ah, Yumi, I knew there was a reason.

411
0:23:2,10 --> 0:23:4,860
And would you tell us
your boyfriend’s name?

412
0:23:4,860 --> 0:23:6,940
No. Sorry, I won’t mom.

413
0:23:6,940 --> 0:23:8,900
See you tonight.

414
0:23:11,180 --> 0:23:12,570
Ugh!

415
0:23:15,880 --> 0:23:18,140
Well, that sure seemed to
satisfy your parents.

416
0:23:18,140 --> 0:23:19,430
What did you tell them?

417
0:23:19,430 --> 0:23:20,690
The truth.

418
0:23:23,320 --> 0:23:34,750
