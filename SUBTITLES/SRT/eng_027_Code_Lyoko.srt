If XANA’s gonna start

have only just begun.

one thing is sure --

you’re gonna have to
program our vehicles faster.

What worries me is
that our friend, XANA,

93
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,660
has obviously found a way
to increase his power.

94
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,360
You think he’s still evolving?

95
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,910
Maybe so.

96
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,620
In any case, from now on,

97
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,400
we have to be ready for
anything and everything.

98
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,250
Maybe I’d better
get back to Lyoko.

99
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,390
If XANA activates a tower,
I’d better be there.

100
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,010
Uh, should we tell her?

101
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:53,840
Hm?

102
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,560
Well, of course
we should tell her!

103
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,540
Why keep good news
like that a secret?

104
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,660
Keep what a secret?

105
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,380
Would someone please
tell me what’s going on?

106
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,800
Over the past few weeks,
I’ve spent all of my time

107
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,700
developing the vehicles and
an antivirus to free you from XANA,

108
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,690
and I also perfected
a whole new program

109
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,290
for detecting activated towers.

110
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,590
A super scanner!

111
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,740
Much more accurate
than the old one.

112
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,460
With instant detection.

113
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,500
Meaning -- you don’t have to
stay on Lyoko all the time!

114
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,380
So I’m gonna live…

Are you all settled in?

everybody’s talking about?

We’re gonna make
a biodiversity scrapbook.

Misses Hertz wants
us to take pictures

paired up to work together.

Great!

Anyone seen Ulrich?

160
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,740
He’s under the arches.

161
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,280
I think he’s waiting for Yumi.

Okay. Yumi, there’s
something I have to tell you.

No, that doesn’t sound right.

Um…Yumi, there’s
something serious

you and I <i>have</i>
to talk about.

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,010
Now we’ll have to
go above ground.

335
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,000
Wait!

336
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,680
Kiwi!

337
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,960
Odd.

338
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,320
There’s a passage over there.

339
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,840
I...I think it leads to the sewers.

340
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,490
This is no time for jokes, Aelita.

341
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,610
I’m not joking, Odd.

342
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,880
I’m sure.

343
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,800
Wow, incredible!

344
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,620
How did you know about this?

345
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,010
Yumi, I um…

346
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,290
Forget it, Ulrich.

347
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,490
I should’ve told you
about William sooner.

348
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,580
Yeah, that would’ve been better.

349
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,000
Aelita!

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,130
I was really worried.

351
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,290
No time to lose, Einstein.

352
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,600
Otherwise, Ulrich and Yumi
will end up like dim sum!

353
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,890
Okay. Head for the scanners.

354
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,330
I’ll start the process.

355
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,880
Transfer Aelita.

356
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,920
Transfer Odd.

357
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,180
Scanner Aelita.

358
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,680
Scanner Odd.

359
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,400
Virtualization.

360
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,920
<i>Aelita, the overwing is for you.
</i>

361
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,180
Our taxis are waiting for us.

362
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,170
Let’s go.

363
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,690
Tower dead ahead.

364
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,360
Be careful.

365
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,420
You’ve got two
tarantulas guarding it.

366
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,460
I’ll never be able
to fight my way

367
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,980
through two of
those horrors!

368
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,130
Maybe I can lure
away one of them.

369
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,760
Oh~

370
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,000
Aelita, what are you
planning on doing?

371
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,140
<i>She’s gonna
steal the show.
</i>

372
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,600
Go ahead.

373
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,720
I won’t look.

374
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,730
(SCREECHING)

375
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,300
Well, my little monster friends,

376
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,860
did you miss me?

377
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,260
Yoo-hoo!

378
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,410
Surprise!

379
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,700
<i>They’re not all that invincible.
</i>

380
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,140
Uh-oh.

381
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,840
Jeremie, I’m all out of ammo.

382
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,020
Okay, I’ll reload you. Be patient.

383
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,930
We’re gonna have to
keep the monsters busy.

384
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,650
Wait for my signal to run.

385
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,850
Gotcha.

386
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,120
Yu…Yumi…

387
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,760
I…um…

388
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,540
What’s, um,
really going on

389
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,170
between you
and…William?

390
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,440
Nothing at all.

391
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,780
He’s just…just a friend.

392
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,560
Done!

393
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,100
You’re fully loaded!

394
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,340
Great, Jeremie!
I’m breaking off.

395
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,160
Aelita!

396
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,610
Now!

397
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,670
(PANTING)

398
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,090
Yes!

399
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,520
Yeah!

400
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,510
(SHATTERS)

401
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,900
Tower deactivated.

402
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,170
Return to the past now.

403
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,720
Congratulations, Miss Delmas.

404
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,440
You found an Amazonian Yuka
here in our woods?

405
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,630
Uh…yeah!

406
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,930
And it wasn’t easy, either!

407
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:14,970
Is that so?

408
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,260
Well, I think it’s going to be
much easier grading you work.

409
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,060
Zero.

410
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,120
Huh!?

411
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,680
So, did you manage to get
any drawing done this time?

412
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,550
Yeah.

413
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,360
But I had to drag Ulrich
far away from Yumi and William.

414
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,950
Going back in time
didn’t change anything there.

415
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,520
I went to check out that
house, The Hermitage.

416
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,530
Nothing to report.

417
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,120
It’s gone back to being
a normal house.

418
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,220
Abandoned, but normal.

419
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,180
It’s so weird.
All those visions I had there.

420
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,840
Not to mention the
underground passage

421
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,170
that you <i>knew</i> about.

422
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,460
It’s as if I had already
seen that house.

423
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,870
In a dream.

424
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,930
A new mystery
to solve for us.

425
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,080
By the way, uh, Aelita,

426
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,400
This is for you.

427
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,420
It’s to keep us one
step ahead of XANA.

428
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,920
For me?

429
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,680
This way, we can
always stay in touch.

430
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,890
Uh, I thought that
pink would suit you.

431
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,260
Wow! Looks cool!

432
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,570
It matches your hair!

433
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,300
(LAUGHS)
Thank you, Jeremie!

434
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,320
There you go!

435
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,410
You’re like a regular
school kid now!

436
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,800
(LAUGHTER)
