Wow! Unbelievable!

14
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,600
Come on, Jeremie, let's get a move on!

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,820
Otherwise, there won't be
any hot water left.

16
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,260
Hey, remember The Hermitage?

17
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,960
You mean the house where
Aelita had those visions?

18
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,050
Bad memory, Jeremie.

19
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,310
Right. Well, I wanted to
check it out a little closer,

20
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,920
and I found out something <i>amazing</i>!

21
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,720
What would really be <i>amazing</i>

22
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,550
Is if there are still some eggs left
when we get down to breakfast!

23
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,660
Odd, you're a real walking stomach,
you know that?

24
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,170
And you're a walking brain!

25
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,470
You see? We compliment each other!

26
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,530
I did a little research to find out
who that old house belonged to,

27
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,850
and I came across a restricted access site.

28
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,260
It took me most of the night to hack into it,

29
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,620
but it was worth it!

30
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,400
I found a deed signed
by a Mr. Franz Hopper.

31
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
Seems that he's the owner.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,470
And do you think it has
something to do with Lyoko?

33
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,150
Ulrich, there's a secret
underground passage

34
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,090
into the sewers from
his yard, believe it or not,

35
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,250
so the guy must've had something
to do with the supercomputer!

36
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,400
Exactly.

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,680
So, I did a search on
Franz Hopper, and guess what.

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,250
He was a science teacher
right here at Kadic Academy.

39
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,980
Is that weird or what!

40
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,740
(WEARY CHATTER)

41
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,610
Ha!

42
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,660
Finally! It's about time!

43
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,400
Every morning, it's the same thing!

44
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,250
Yeah. But things might start
moving now that Sissi's done.

45
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,540
Shut up, kiddies!

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,520
Poor thing!

47
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,960
You'll be here for
another two hours!

48
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,700
Why not go upstairs?

49
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,620
There's some showers free up there,
and not a girl in sight.

50
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,820
(CLAMORING)

51
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,370
The girl's showers
are downstairs, Aelita!

52
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,740
Aelita Stones! Hey!

53
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,210
what do you think you're doing here?

54
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,210
Please go easy on her, Jim.

55
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,320
She's new here.

56
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,850
Right. Well, new or not,

57
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,690
a young lady has no business
in the boy's showers.

58
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,450
But I-I thought that--

59
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,450
I don't want to hear your excuses!

60
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,620
Pull that again, and you go
straight to the principal's office!

61
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,850
Hmph!

62
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,650
Well, Miss Einstein,
it's just like I said, huh.

63
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,040
Not a single girl
in these showers.

64
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,340
Sissi, we're sick of
your bad jokes, so chill.

65
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,120
Can't you give Aelita
a break for once?

66
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,840
You knew she'd believe you, right?

67
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,730
What can I say, Ulrich sweetie,

68
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,780
she's gonna have to adapt, isn't she?

69
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,160
It's a jungle out there.

70
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,320
You can say that again!

71
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,640
I'm looking at a
big baboon right now!

72
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,820
(LAUGHS)

73
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,580
Shut up, you!

74
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,170
Sissi's such a brat.

75
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,570
<i>And to think you guys
actually kissed once.</i>

76
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,140
<i>Hey, cool it, huh.</i>

77
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,780
<i>That's ancient history.</i>

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,940
So, you think the
owner of the Hermitage

79
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,260
and the science teacher
are the same person?

80
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,770
Well, let's face it, huh.

81
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,690
Finding two guys called Franz Hopper

82
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,610
in a radius of less than half a mile

83
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,020
would sure be a real coincidence.

84
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,850
Anyway, there's only
one way to be sure.

85
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,720
After history class, we have
a study period in the library.

86
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,820
What do you say we do a little research
in the Kadic Academy archives?

87
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,680
Good idea.

88
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,700
I'll go with you.

89
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,160
I don't think that's a good idea.

90
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,140
You already got into trouble
in the showers this morning.

91
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,490
if Jim catches you snooping
around in the archives,

92
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,960
you'll be suspended for sure.

93
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,770
Okay. See you later.

94
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,320
We'll meet you in the cafeteria.

95

(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

96
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,810
Are you alright, Aelita?

97
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,320
I can't get used to living here.

98
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,450
I had another nightmare last night.

99
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,770
The same one.

100
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,920
You haven't even been here for a week yet!

101
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,380
You'll see. You'll feel better in no time.

Ah, shoot.

00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,540
Shouldn't you be in class?

107
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,520
Well, children?

108
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,250

at this time of day, if you
can't find your teachers,

117
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,600
it probably means they're in class.

No doubt about it.

I compared the teacher's signature

00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,720
with the one on the property deed
I found on the internet.

They're the same.

Hmm.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,060
What if we had a look
around the Hermitage

141
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,050
to find out more
about this teacher?

Good idea.

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,820
But…aren't we supposed to
meet Aelita in the cafeteria now?

144

It'll only take a minute.
She won't mind waiting a little.

Why not?

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,480
At least I'd feel at home there!

How should I know?

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,720
If this Franz Hopper guy
has anything to do with XANA,

154

maybe we'll find some information
about Aelita's virus for a start.

00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,220
You really are lame in history.

168
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,870
You see all these notes?

169
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,790
I'm sure Hopper wrote them.

170
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,580
Quiet, please. Where's Aelita Stones?

171
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,360
Jeremie, do you know
why Aelita isn't here?

172
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,380
Aelita? Huh!

173
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,840
Uh…huh?

174
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,500
Um…sorry, mam, I don't.

175
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,440
Well, I do, mam!
She went back to Canada!

176
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,420
Canada?

177
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,120
Yeah, that's what she told me!

178
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,460
She even said, "At least I
feel at home there."

179
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,760
Elizabeth, if you continue to
disrupt the class, I warn you,

180
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,920
I will send you to your father's office.

181
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,160
(mutters):
It's Sissi, not Elizabeth!

182
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
I hate being called Elizabeth!

183
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,450
Mam, um, I don't feel very well.

184
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,200
Can I please go to the infirmary?

185
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,560
Of course, Jeremie.

186
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,180
Can we take him?

187
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,180
Can we take him?

188
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,760
Well, oh…

189
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,640
Oh, alright, then.

190
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,700
But don't dilly-dally!

191
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,250
Jeremie, wait! Hey!

192
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,600
Where are you going?

193
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,900
To the factory!

194
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,280
You think Aelita's there?

195
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,470
She told Sissi she was
going back to Canada.

196
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,380
I think she meant, "I'm going back
to the place I came from,"

197
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,280
which means Lyoko.

198
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,700
Okay. I found her.

199
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,920
She virtualized herself all on her own.

200
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,460
That's pretty weird.

201
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,340
Why would she do that?

202
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,820
Maybe she got homesick.

203
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,320
Does Yumi know?

204
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,600
I left her a message.

205
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,260
Get to the scanner room. Hurry!

206
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,180
Aelita, can you hear me?

207
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,500
<i>Answer me!</i>

208
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,100
Ah, Yumi!

209
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,820
I got the message
at the swimming pool.

210
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,360
What's going on?

211
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,600
Run to the scanner room.

212
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,700
Ulrich and Odd are already there.
I'll explain later.

213
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,940
Jeremie, help!

214
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,060
Aelita! Don't worry.
The others are on the way.

<i>She's due north!</i>

00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,480

224
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,320
Jeremie, I'm surrounded!

225
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,750
Hurry up! Aelita's fallen into a trap!

226

227
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,650
Go ahead, Ulrich.

228
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,060
With your speed,
you'll get there first.

229
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,770
You're right.

230
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,050
Too late.

231
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,970

Okay. Battle stations.

234
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,770
Aelita's bought some time.

235
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,090
Your move, Odd.

236
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,000
I love this.

Nice going, guys.

But hurry it up!

241
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,540
The bloks are catching up to Aelita.

242
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,370
What are you waiting for? Call us a taxi!

243
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,700
It's on the way.

244
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,720
Hurry, Jeremie!

What? She's already gone?

251
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,790
She must really be mad at us.

252

This is no time for jokes, Odd.

253
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,680
I've lost Aelita from my screens.

You…you mean she's…

No! Uh, I doubt it.

Wait.

259
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,330
Got it! I got a signal!

260
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,680
A very weak one, but…

261

Hey, that's strange.

Wait.

<i>No. Not really.</i>

00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,490
Destroy it! That thing is
taking away Aelita's memory!

334
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,220
Something weird's happening.

335
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,410
Oh, no! That can't be good!

336
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,220
<i>Get out of there!</i>

337
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,880
Got it.

338
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,240
<i>Odd, beat it!</i>

339
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,340
Just in time!

340
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,700
(PANTING)

341
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,810
Now, what?

342
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,680
Wait. I'm re-entering the code.

343
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,980
Scipio.

344
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,580
We've got your ticket out of here, Aelita.

345
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,810
<i>And there you go.</i>

346
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,800
<i>I'm bringing you in right now.</i>

347
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,010
<i>Aelita, all you have to do
is get to the tower, and I'll</i>

348
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,610
rematerialize you.

349
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,730
<i>Materialization Yumi.</i>

350
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,840
<i>Materialization Odd.</i>

351
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,740
<i>Materialization Ulrich.</i>

352
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,140
(SIGHS)

353
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,180
You should've seen it, Jeremie.

354
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,780
There were all these creepy things,

355
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,650
and in the middle, this kind of
huge jellyfish holding Aelita!

356
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,930
(GROWLS)

357
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,380
Can you imagine? That thing
was stealing my memory.

358
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,420
Yeah. One thing is sure --

359
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,490
XANA wants to get something
out of you, but what?

360
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,770
That's what we have to find out.

361
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,900
I can't wait to go back to the fifth sector.

362
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,700
There's so much to explore there.

363
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,330
I'll go with you.
It'll be totally awesome.

364
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,170
Whoa, not so fast!

365
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,740
I have to study it first!

366
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,340
For now, it's uncharted territory,

367
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,500
which means it could be
totally <i>dangerous</i>!

368
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,300
Um…you're not angry at me for
going back to Lyoko by myself?

369
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,810
I…I don't know what got into me.

370
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,720
I just needed to…

371
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,800
You don't have to explain, Aelita.

372
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,700
We understand what happened.

373
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,850
And we're not angry at all.

374
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,250
I promise to spend
more time with you.

375
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,650
Yeah! And if you want,

376
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,900
I'll teach you plenty of ways
to tell Sissi to go to--

377
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,780
Odd!

378
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,000
Do you know what your
filthy mutt did in the shower?

379
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,360
Oh!

380
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,700
What a pretty picture!

381
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,400
So, you've finally found
Misses Einstein!

382
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,380
Yeah, while you were taking
your <i>third shower</i> of the day.

383
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,000
Well, you know, Ulrich dear,

384
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,690
a beautiful flower like me
needs to be watered often!

385
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,260
You--

386
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,360
Yes, you never know!
You might just sprout a brain!

387
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,140
(LAUGHTER)

388
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,480
Morons!

389
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,460
I think you can give <i>Odd</i> lessons, Aelita.

390
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,690
You sure learn fast!

391
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:33,640
