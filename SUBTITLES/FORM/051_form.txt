YUMI: I’ve got a bad feeling about this.\NAre you almost done Aelita?
AELITA: Yes, almost.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Watch out, \Nanother squadron of Mantas is headed your way!
AELITA: Done, the controls are all yours Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Great! \NHere come your vehicles.
Okay guys, the passage is open.
AELITA: So, anything good?
JEREMIE: No. I wouldn’t call it good.
AELITA: Huh?
JEREMIE: More like amazing!
With this, I bet I can crack the code of Franz Hopper’s diary!
ULRICH: Way cool.
AELITA: The only problem is I’m gonna need a supercomputer--\N--to process such a large amount of data.
I’ll have to activate a tower or two.
YUMI: Uh, that didn’t go very well last time, \NXANA hates it when we play with his toys.
JEREMIE: I know. But we don’t have a choice.
ODD: Right, can we go eat now?\NIt’s mashed potatoes today!
JEREMIE: You can have mine. I better stay here to prepare the mission.\NThat way, you can set out right after lunch.
Um, Jeremie’s not coming,\Nhe said I could have his portion too Rosa.
ODD: Yeah!
ROSA: With everything you put away,\NI just don’t understand how you can be so scrawny.
ODD: I am not scrawny, I’m svelte.
--Ulrich, stop holding out on us.\NWhat’s your overall average?
ULRICH: 73 for the term.
ODD: For me, I got 75.
I beat ya.
ULRICH: Only because you made up some points in art class.
What about Aelita, \Nwhat’s your grade point average?
AELITA: 95.2
Um, but it’s only because of math.
ULRICH: Yes, but still you must have gotten--\N--good grades in all of your classes.
It’s great, especially since you’re not really…
ODD: Uh...
ULRICH: Uh, I mean…
AELITA: Don’t worry,\NI know very well I’m not really human.
Still, sometimes I get a strange feeling as if…
As if I’ve already lived here. Weird, huh?
ODD: That’s just the magical Odd-effect.
You know, you see me once and you feel like you’ve known me forever.
ULRICH: Hey magic Odd-effect you know you got some mashed potatoes right on your face.
ODD: No way!
ULRICH: Something wrong?
ODD: Not really.\NSome girl wants me to meet her in the woods.
AELITA: You kidding?
Who?
ODD: The number’s masked. 
No doubt about it, it’s just another girl who’s--\N--just too shy to admit she’s crazy about me.
ULRICH: You know Odd, your love life is like something out of a soap opera.
ODD: Oh yeah? And yours is real simple?
JEREMIE: An activated tower, oh boy. That’s all I needed.
SFX: (PHONE RINGING)
ULRICH: Yeah, Jeremie? 
Huh? Okay, we’re on our way.\NActivated tower. You call Yumi, I’ll tell Odd.
ODD: Are you there? It’s me Odd!
What do you mean, ”SOS XANA”, no way!\NNot now!
Who’s there? No,\NNo.
No!\NNO!
JEREMIE: Where’s Odd?
ULRICH: I sent him a text message,\Nbut he was supposed to be meeting some sort of mystery girl.
JEREMIE: A girl? What girl?
ULRICH: Mystery girls don’t leave their names.
JEREMIE: I hope he won’t he won’t be much longer. 
Not only we have to decode Franz Hopper’s notes,\Nbut now we have to deactivate the tower as well.
YUMI: Okay, let’s go.
JEREMIE: Come on, Odd, pick up!
He’s not answering, forget him for now.
{\i1}He’ll meet you later.
{\i1}Transfer, Ulrich.
{\i1}Transfer, Aelita.
{\i1}Transfer, Yumi.
{\i1}Scanner, Ulrich.
Scanner, Yumi.
{\i1}Scanner, Aelita.
Virtualization.
ODD: Here I am Jeremie.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Not a minute too soon.{\i0}\NI’ve been trying to call you.
ODD: I was busy.
JEREMIE: Huh? Well get ready, I’ll launch the procedure.
{\i1}Transfer, Odd.
{\i1}Scanner, Odd.
Virtualization.
What?
What’s going on here?
{\i1}Odd?
ODD: Everything’s okay, I’m on Lyoko.
JEREMIE: There was a bug during the transfer. Oh, no way!
The tower has just deactivated itself.
ULRICH: Are you sure?
JEREMIE: {\i1}Yeah, the superscan shows all clear.\NAs if XANA has called off his attack.
ULRICH: Well, that’s one less thing for us to worry about, right?
Right Odd?
ODD: Right.
ULRICH: What’s up with him?\NIs he sulking or something?
AELITA: Maybe his rendezvous didn’t go well.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Here are your rides, please remember we have a diary to decode.
I’ve chosen the tower at 72 degrees south, and 55 degrees west.
YUMI: There it is!
DEFAULT: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
JEREMIE: As soon as I activate the tower,\Nstart the decoding process.
DEFAULT: (HUMMING CONTINUES)
AELITA: I’m ready, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Ok, I’m activating the tower…\NNow!
Yeah! It’s working!
AELITA: The deconing of the data’s underway, Jeremie,\Nbut it might take some time.
JEREMIE: No problem, whenever Xana leave us in peace, \Neverything’s cool.
Uh oh, I spoke too soon.
Watch out, Xana’s creatures heading your way.
YUMI: Where from? We can’t see anything.
Huh?
ULRICH: There!
Wow, Xana’s pulled out the big guns.
Hey!\NHuh?
Jeremie, Xana’s taken over Odd!
JEREMIE: What?
ULRICH: Yes, I’m sure of it.
{\i1}I don’t know how Xana did it.
JEREMIE: I do, it’s not the real Odd.
YUMI: What?
JEREMIE: It’s one of Xana’s creatures,\Na polymorphing spectre.
YUMI: But where’s the real Odd then?
ODD: Hey! Is anybody there?
Yohoo!\N{\i1}Help!
ULRICH: Talk about a tailgater,\Nworse than Sissi.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Ulrich, it’s a trap, he’s trying to lead you away from the tower.
ULRICH: But why?
AELITA: Jeremie, what’s going on?\N{\i1}Is there a problem?
JEREMIE: Oh man.
Xana’s trying to gain control of the tower,\Nabort the mission!
Stop the decoding,\N{\i1}and come back to Earth.
AELITA: Ok.
JEREMIE: Yumi, where are you?
YUMI: In the woods.\N{\i1}But it’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack.
JEREMIE: Wait, while I was hacking into the network,\NI managed to locate the emergency telephone closest to Odd’s phone.
YUMI: {\i1}You can do that?
JEREMIE: Ofcourse I can.
If odd still has his cell on him,\N{\i1}then he’s in the north-east corner of the woods.
YUMI: That’s near the Hermitage, I’m off.
AELITA: Jeremie, we’ve got a problem,\NI can’t stop the decoding program,
{\i1}it’s taking up too many resources,\Nit’s out of my control now.
JEREMIE: Bad news, if Xana manages to take control of the tower now, \Nhe’ll be able to get into the restricted access part of the supercomputer. 
I could lose all the data in Franz Hopper’s diary.
AELITA: {\i1}No to mention everything you’ve programed in yourself.
{\i1}Our combat gear, the vehicles, the transfer codes,\Nand my materialization program.
JEREMIE: This is a nightmare.\NUlrich!
{\i1}Xana’s about to take control of the tower, you have to stop it.
ULRICH: Uh, right, ok, but how?
JEREMIE: {\i1}You have to isolate the tower, try to cut the cables, hurry!
ULRICH: You’re wasting your time, Xana, Odd has never beaten me yet.
Uh well yeah, ok uh, that changes things.
ODD: Help!
SFX: (PHONE RINGS)
YUMI: Odd?\NOdd!
JEREMIE: Xana’s going to do it,\NAelita. Is there anything new?
AELITA: There’s no way to stop the process,\Neverything’s buggy.
ODD: Help!\NHelp!
ULRICH: Hey, you’re not so bad there, Xana.
Whoa! Full of surprises, huh?
Hey, no fair!
ODD: It figures, \Nat least I don’t have to climb anymore.
Well I guess you can say I’m really up to my neck in trouble this time.
JEREMIE: Xana’s about to take over!\NUlrich, what are you doing?
ULRICH: I just got one last little thing to take care of.
All done Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Make it fast, now!
Ulrich!
YUMI: Odd?
Odd!
ODD: Yumi, I’m here!
Yumi!\NYumi!
YUMI: Odd?\NOdd?
Odd!
JEREMIE: Xana is about to steal all my data!\NWe’re done for!
AELITA: Hey!
JEREMIE: What’s going on?
Aelita?
AELITA: {\i1}I don’t get it, it looks like Xana has lost control of the tower.
JEREMIE: Franz Hopper!
{\i1}Franz Hopper’s helping us!\NWhat’s going on on your side?
AELITA: The decoding program is going full speed.
ODD: No girls have ever kept me waiting that long.
SFX: (LAUGHTER)
JEREMIE: Huh?
AELITA: Amazing.
JEREMIE: Yumi.
YUMI: I’ve got Odd, how about you?
JEREMIE: We’re decoding Franz Hopper’s diary.
Franz Hopper {\i1}was{\i0} the creator of Xana.
In his diary, he wrote everything that happened during the creation of Lyoko.
Everything.
AELITA: That means you’ll be able to find the antivirus!
JEREMIE: Yeah, it does, but there’s something more.
ULRICH: What?\NCome on, spit it out.
JEREMIE: Well, before Franz Hopper virtualized {\i1}himself{\i0} on Lyoko,\Nand before being taken prisoner by Xana, he lived here on Earth.
YUMI: We already knew that.
JEREMIE: Yes, but what you didn’t know was that he had a child, a little girl.
ODD: Really? Well what became of her?
JEREMIE: He virtualized her on Lyoko at the same time as himself.
YUMI: And?\NDid she fall victim to Xana, too?
JEREMIE: No, she stayed on Lyoko.
AELITA: But that’s impossible, if Hopper’s daughter--\N--were on Lyoko, I would have definitely known, I--
I’m-- Not...
