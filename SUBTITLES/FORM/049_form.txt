YUMI: A-hm?
JEREMY: Yumi? It’s Jeremy.
We need you to come to the\Nfactory right now!
The superscan has just picked up\Nan attack from Xana.
And this one looks like big trouble.
YUMI: Why?
JEREMY: Because believe it or not,\Nthere are five activated towers.
JEREMIE: I’ve got a bad feeling about this one.
ODD: Relax Einstein, we’ll take care of\Nyour five towers in no time.
YUMI: I got here as quickly as I could.
JEREMIE: Huh?
FRANZ: Ah, there you are.
I’ve been expecting you.
That Xana locks the door,\Nbut leaves the window wide open.
JEREMIE: Bu- but I mean,\Nwh- what are you doing here?
FRANZ: I’m deactivating the towers.
JEREMIE: Without going to Lyoko?
FRANZ: Of course.
AELITA: But-ah, who are you?
FRANZ: What?
Haven’t you understood yet?
I’m Franz Hopper.
AELITA: Huh?
JEREMIE: Huh?
FRANZ: I’m the one who created Lyoko,\Nand Xana too.
But then I lost control of it.
In the very beginning it was a program\Nthat I designed to counter a military project
based on a multi-agent system.
AELITA: Well, what about me?
FRANZ: Eh?
I created you to be the guardian of Lyoko.
But I never thought I’d see you\None day in flesh and blood.
ULRICH: But then, where have you\Nbeen for these last few years.
FRANZ: Well let’s say I was kind of prisoner,\Nwho finally managed to escape.
YUMI: What now then?
FRANZ: We’ve got to destroy Xana\Nfor once and for all.
JEREMIE: We’d love to,\Nbut Xana’s given Aelita a bug.
If we switch the supercomputer off,\Nthen Aelita switches off too.
FRANZ: We’ll find the anti-virus. You’ll see.
JEREMIE: Sure, but how?
FRANZ: Well, that young man is why I came.\NI’m here to help.
AELITA: He’s very fatherly,\Nactually in a way he is my father.
He’s the one who created me.
JEREMIE: That’s true.
I adore my own dad,\Nbut he’s sure no genius.
But this Franz Hopper is a real live genious.
AELITA: Yeah, that’s it for me.\NI’m gonna go to bed.
JEREMIE: Okay, good night.
AELITA: Good night Jeremie.
MR. BELPOIS: Jeremie? It’s me.
JEREMIE: Franz?
MR. BELPOIS: No, Michael. Your father.\NDo you know why I’m calling?
Happy birthday big guy.
JEREMIE: Huh?
DEFAULT: HAPPY BIRTHDAY EINSTEIN!
MR. BELPOIS: By the way,\Nyour mother’s worried about you.
You should call us more often.
Now, have you thought about \Nthat school for gifted children?
Jeremie?
JEREMIE: Uh, yeah sure.\NOk dad, sure.
Eh, listen I have to go.\NMy friends just came in.
Talk to you soon!
ODD: Here, a present.
ULRICH: What are you waiting for,\Ngo on, open it!
ODD: Teehee.
JEREMIE: Wow! It’s great!
ODD: Yeah! And I drew it from memory!
ULRICH: So you can imagine\Nhow much effort it took.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
JEREMIE: Thanks everyone!
Hey, how about going over\Nto the factory now?
I can’t wait to see Franz again.
FRANZ: You used the scanners to\Nvirtualize human beings?
JEREMIE: Well, yes.
It’s the only way we could\Nfind to deactivate towers on Lyoko.
FRANZ: The virtualization process\Nwas not ready for that yet.
It’s a very dangerous procedure,\Nwith serious side effects.
YUMI: Such as?
FRANZ: Cell degeneration.
Odd seems ok.
Ulrich too.
But Yumi…
JEREMIE: No! It can’t be!
YUMI: I can’t believe it!\NWhat a nightmare.
ODD: Nice one Einstein,
Dr. Shrank transplants animal limbs\Nonto human beings,
but compared to you he’s small time.
JEREMIE: I… I couldn’t have known.
I’m sorry.
ULRICH: You’re sorry?
Well that’s not gonna help cure Yumi.
JEREMIE: Yumi, I…
YUMI: Leave me alone Jeremie…
I need to be by myself.
You coming Ulrich?
JEREMIE: I’m sure there is\Na way to cure Yumi.
ODD: We don’t even know\Nexactly what’s wrong with her.
JEREMIE: I’ll work it out.\NI promise I will.
ULRICH: I think you’ve done\Nenough damage as it is.
JEREMIE: What do you mean by that?!
That everything’s been my\Nfault right from the start?!
ULRICH: You’re the brains in this\Noutfit, Einstein.
AELITA: You know Ulrich,\Nif it weren’t for the scanners,
I wouldn’t be here.
MS. ISHIYAMA: Yumi?\NAre you okay?
YUMI: I’m not very hungry tonight.
HIROKI: -laughter- Ohh Ulrich, I looove you. -laughter-
MS. ISHIYAMA: Hiroki…
YUMI: I’m going to bed.
MS. ISHIYAMA: That’s it then.\NWe’re in the thick of it now.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Of what?
MS. ISHIYAMA: A teenage crisis.
YUMI: Hello?
FRANZ: Yumi? It’s Franz.
I have some good news.
Tell the others and meet me\Nfirst thing tomorrow at the Factory.
YUMI: Okay, we’ll be there.
FRANZ: I now know how to program\Nthe anti-virus which will free Aelita.
All I need now is the data from Sector 5.
AELITA: Great! We’ll go and get it then.
JEREMIE: I thought the scanners\Nwere too dangerous to use.
FRANZ: If we wanna to get to Sector 5,\Nthen we have no choice.
ODD: It’ll be our final mission.
JEREMIE: Okay, then what am I supposed to do?
FRANZ: If I were you,\NI’d stay out of the way.
JEREMIE: It’s not fair!
Everyone blames me for everything,
and after all we all turned on\Nthe supercomputer back on together.
FRANZ: Perhaps, but you were the one\Nwho played sorcerer’s apprentice.
You’re the one who put your\Nfriends lives at risk.
And you’re the one who let\NXana destroy my diary.
JEREMIE: Fine, I get it.
AELITA: Jeremie!
FRANZ: Right, shall we?
MR. BELPOIS: Hello?
JEREMIE: Dad, it’s me.
MR. BELPOIS: Jeremie?
JEREMIE: You know that school for gifted children,\Nthat you were talking about?
MR. BELPOIS: Yes?
JEREMIE: I wanna go.\NCan you come and get me?
MR. BELPOIS: When?
JEREMIE: As soon as possible.
MR. BELPOIS: Okay, I’ll be there tomorrow.
JEREMIE: Oh, right. Alright then.
FRANZ: Transfer Ulrich.
Transfer Yumi.
Transfer Odd.
Scanner Yumi.
Scanner Ulrich.
Scanner Odd.
Virtualization.
ULRICH: Hey! We’ve arrived directly in Sector 5!
FRANZ: Of course.
There is a direct access.\NThe transporter’s a bit outdated.
ODD: Cool!
FRANZ: And you’re the one who let\NXana destroy my diary…
JEREMIE: Franz Hopper’s diary…
But how could he know,\Nthat diary was destroyed?
YUMI: Maybe you’ll find out more about\Nthe mysterious owner of the Hermitage.
JEREMIE: Everything’s encrypted,\NI have to decode it.
FRANZ: And you’re the one who let\NXana destroy my diary…
JEREMIE: Huh? How could Franz Hopper know that?!
AELITA: Xana took control of you.
JEREMIE: He destroyed all of Franz Hopper’s Cds.
Apparently had a problem with those notes.
FRANZ: And you’re the one who let\NXana destroy my diary…
JEREMIE: Xana.
FRANZ: The countdown has begun.\NClean up, and I’ll send Aelita over.
YUMI: Alright.
ODD: Franz? I don’t mind cleaning up,\Nbut we’re gonna need some industrial strength detergent.
FRANZ: No problem, I’ve programmed each some new weapons!
ODD: Uhh, I don’t see what’s new about this…
ODD: Woo-hoo! Homing darts!
ULRICH: There’s the key! Leave it to me.
YUMI: Ulrich, how are you doing?
ULRICH: It’s a done deal.
FRANZ: Well done Ulrich.
YUMI: Alrighty.
ODD: It’s almost too easy.\NI want more Creepers.
FRANZ: Don’t worry Odd.\NIt’s not over yet.
I’ve got more surprises in store for you.
Aelita, are you ready for virtualization?
AELITA: Yes.
JEREMIE: Sssh!
AELITA: Huh?
FRANZ: Here we go.
Transfer Aelita.
Scanner.
Virtualization.
AELITA: Yumi?\NUlrich?
Odd?
Franz, I’m not in Sector 5.\NWhat’s going on?
FRANZ: Everything’s under control.
Jeremie, what are you doing here?
JEREMIE: I just came to see\Nhow you’re managing, Xana.
FRANZ: You’re very clever Jeremie,\Nbut you’re too late.
ODD: Hey, wanna make this a contest?\NWhoever get’s the most, wins!
YUMI: What’s going on? Franz?!
ODD: Something’s wrong!
Let’s get out of here.
YUMI: I get the feeling we’ve been double crossed.
ODD: Bye!
FRANZ: Now your friends are in a little trouble.
I’ve fixed things so that they can never rematerialize.
No more life-points and it’s bye-bye!
And now, for the grand finale.
ULRICH: What now?
ODD: Well, there’s only one thing to do.
Franz! We need help!
YUMI: No! Not Franz, Xana!
ODD: This must be the surprise…
JEREMIE: Huh?
ODD: Hellooo? You had enough?
Ciao!
FRANZ: Admit you’re defeated Jeremie.
JEREMIE: No. Not this time.
FRANZ: Hm?
What’s the meaning of this?!
JEREMIE: A decoy.
FRANZ: Huh? Noooooo!
JEREMIE: Wow!
YUMI: I’ve often wondered how this would all end.\NNow I know, this is it.
No! Ulrich!
ODD: It can’t be!
JEREMIE: C’mon! Don’t be so pessimistic Odd.
YUMI: Jeremie?
JEREMIE: Yes, I’m back.\NCome on, let’s start over.
ODD: Nothing like my trusty old gear.
YUMI: What about Ulrich?
JEREMIE: All’s well, I managed to\Nreprogram the materialization just in time.
He’s home.\NReady Aelita?
AELITA: Yes Jeremie.
JEREMIE: All we gotta do now,\Nis to deactivate the tower.
I’m sending you Aelita.\NVirtualization.
Aelita, I’m entering the code SCIPIO.
ULRICH: Jeremie?!
What’s going on?\NWhat can I do?
AELITA: Jeremie,\NI’m in the core zone.
ULRICH: Aelita?
Deactivate the tower, hurry up!
AELITA: Hurry!
Jeremie’s in trouble.
ULRICH: Jeremie!
ODD: Aelita!
ULRICH: Hang in there, please!
AELITA: Tower deactivated.
ULRICH: Don’t worry buddy, everything’s okay now.
JEREMIE: Of course I’m not angry with you.
What’s more, I checked out your bio-schematic\Nduring your rematerialization phase.
There’s no sign of alteration whatsoever.
YUMI: Oh, what a relief!
He really had me scared, that Franz Hopper.
JEREMIE: That false Franz Hopper.
The real one is still somewhere on Lyoko.
ODD: Huh?
JEREMIE: Dad?!
MR. BELPOIS: Are you ready son? Let’s go.
JEREMIE: Wait, things have changed.
Lemme explain.
MR. BELPOIS: You sure you’ve thought it over?
JEREMIE: Yes.
I’m really sorry I made you come\Nall the way out here for nothing.
MR. BELPOIS: Don’t you worry about it.
And don’t forget to give us a call from time to time.
JEREMIE: I promise.
ODD: Hey, what’s going on here?\NWhere were you going?
JEREMIE: Nowhere.
AELITA: Your father seems like a really nice guy.
JEREMIE: Yeah, I love him.
He’s great.
ULRICH: Like father like son.
