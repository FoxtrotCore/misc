WILLIAM: Huh!
MATHIAS: Oh wow…\NI sure am glad brushed my teeth this morning!

ODD: Don’t you wanna sit by Heidi?\NShe’s all by herself.
JEREMIE: Hm?

ODD: You know something?\NYou sure threw me a real curveball there Mr. Romantic…
JEREMIE: But, I…
ULRICH: Guess you won’t be needing this croissant.\NLater.
WILLIAM: Hey Ulrich, glad I ran into you.
In case you haven’t heard the latest news,\NYumi’s going out with Mathias Durrell.
YUMI: Morning everyone!
Hey, thanks Ulrich!
ULRICH: So, you really like Durrell, do you?
YUMI: He’s a nice guy, why?
WILLIAM: How does he kiss, huh?
YUMI: Kiss? How should I know?
ULRICH: Cut out the acting Yumi, William saw you.

JEREMIE: No kidding?\NWell rumor has it I kissed Heidi Klinger.

HERB: Ulrich will never go out with you.\NHe said so, I heard him!
Hey, speak of the devil, there he is!\NWhy don’t you ask him yourself?
JEREMIE: Hey!
SISSI: Hehe, what were you saying?
HERB: How does he do it?\NWhat does he have that I don’t?
NICHOLAS: Everything.
Except for your gross pimples.
HERB: I dare you to say that again!
SISSI: Hey Yumi, everything okay?
DEFAULT: (BELL RINGING)
TEACHER: Yes, right. Last time we were\Ndiscussing the causes of World War I.
JEREMIE: Aelita, can we talk?
AELITA: We’re in class.
ULRICH: Why did you kiss Heidi?
JEREMIE: I did not kiss Heidi.
ULRICH: I saw you.
It wasn’t a very nice thing to do to Odd.
JEREMIE: Then what about you?\NKissing Sissi to get back at Yumi, you call that nice?
ULRICH: What? I didn’t kiss Sissi.
JEREMIE: I saw you.
TEACHER: And now my first question is,\Nwhen did Galleani die?
Well class, I’m waiting… \NUlrich? When did Galleani die?
ULRICH: Well, uh at the end of his life?
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
JIM: Stern? What are you doing here?\NYou should be in class.
Huh?
Oh, is that you Yolanda?
Hey.
JEREMIE: Hey, Aelita!
AELITA: Jeremie?\NYou wanted to talk to me?
JEREMIE: Yeah, let’s talk about you and Nicholas.
AELITA: Huh?
JEREMIE: I sure hope he’s better at kissing than he is at math.
AELITA: What are you talking about?\NI never kissed Nicholas!
JEREMIE: I don’t believe this!
First you kiss the biggest loser in the whole school,\Nand then you lie about it?
AELITA: But, Jeremie? Trust me.
JEREMIE: Incredible.
You make a fool of me in public,\Nthen you lie to me and now you expect me trust you?
How could you do that? You really let me down.
You have no idea how much either.
JEREMIE: Oh no.
ULRICH: I’m telling you, I never kissed Sissi!
Hello?
JEREMIE: {\i1}XANA’s attacking!
ULRICH: {\i1}Okay, let’s meet in the park!
AELITA: {\i1}Hello, this is Aelita. Leave me a message.
JEREMIE: Right, I can explain everything.\NAll this kissing is another one of XANA’s schemes that--
ODD: That doesn’t make any sense, he can’t control us.
JEREMIE: I know that, but I also know that I did not kiss Heidi,\Nso there must be a Jeremie clone somewhere.
YUMI: And a Yumi clone.
ULRICH: And an Ulrich clone also.
JEREMIE: Right, and I bet they’re all just\None big polymorphic clone.
ODD: A poly-what?
JEREMIE: A polymorphic clone,\Nit can change its appearance at will.
XANA must have sent a kind of ghost\Nthat look like anyone it wants to.
ULRICH: But why?
YUMI: To make trouble in our group,\Nto divide and conquer.
ULRICH: XANA’s really smart,\Nnot like us.
JEREMIE: I guess Odd was right,\Njealousy makes people crazy.
ODD: Listen, we gotta go to Lyoko\Nto solve this. Hey, where’s Aelita?
JEREMIE: Gone, and all because of me.
YUMI: Oh bravo, where did she go?
JEREMIE: Hm… I think I might know.
Aelita?
AELITA: Jeremie?
JEREMIE: I’m really sorry Aelita.
AELITA: You’re... not angry with me anymore?
JEREMIE: No, I figured it out.
You see XANA was using a polymorph\Nthat can change its appearance at will.
AELITA: So you didn’t really kiss Heidi?
JEREMIE: No. Let’s go now.\NWe have to get to the factory fast.
You’re not too upset with me, are you?
Let’s go!
Aelita!
AELITA: Jeremie? But...
JEREMIE: It’s Xana!
He made a clone of me to trick you.
Don’t listen to him Aelita, he’s Xana!
ODD: If I’ve got this straight,\None of these two is the poly-dorking clone, right?
YUMI: The polymorphic clone, Odd.
JEREMIE: Aelita, trust me.
Don’t listen to him, I’m the real Jeremie!
You know I am, I kissed you.
AELITA: That’s right.
The real Jeremie would not have kissed me like that.
JEREMIE: Keep your hands off her!
AELITA: Quick! To the factory!
ODD: You guys go on, I’ll take care of him.
Oh no, not the big tough guy.
JEREMIE: Head for the scanners.
I’m launching the virtualization process.
Transfer Yumi.
Transfer Aelita.
Transfer Ulrich.
Scanner Yumi.
Scanner Aelita.
Scanner Ulrich.
Virtualization!
{\i1}The tower isn’t far away,\Ndirection North, North-East.
AELITA: There, across the bridge!
ODD: Hey, Xana?
If you’re gonna keep changing appearances like that,\Ndo me a favor and turn into a wimp next time.
Oh no, not him, I know his kind, \Nsmall but tough as nails.
JEREMIE: Hurry up!
ULRICH: Aelita, head for the tower.\NI’ll take care of them.
ODD: What did I tell ya?
JEREMIE: {\i1}Xana’s sending a monster!
You’re almost there, Aelita!
ULRICH: Supersprint!
YUMI: Ulrich!
ULRICH: Let’s swap monsters.
YUMI: Okay.
ULRICH: Here we go.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Careful Yumi, at ten o’clock!
I’ll materialize the Overwing.
YUMI: Thanks Jeremie.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Careful, behind you Ulrich!\NHornets!
ULRICH: Yumi!
JEREMIE: Aelita! Hurry up!
AELITA: {\i1}I’m nearly there!
Jeremie! \NI’m trapped.
YUMI: Why isn’t this elevator working?
JEREMIE: Ulrich! The scyphozoa is attacking Aelita.
Forget about the monster for now.
ULRICH: {\i1}Hey, it’s no picnic out here!
 JEREMIE: You okay Yumi?
ULRICH: Jeremie, I’m gonna need the Overbike!
JEREMIE: You got it, Ulrich.
Don’t worry Yumi, we’ll manage.
ODD: Okay poly-whatever.\NI’m gonna transform you now!
YUMI: Devirtualization.
ULRICH: Hey Jeremie, what’s going on?
{\i1}Jeremie?\NAnswer me!
YUMI: Jeremie?
What’d you do to him?
ODD: Yumi!
YUMI: Odd, help me it’s Xana.\NYou’re not gonna believe this polymorph, are you?
Odd no, cut it out peabrain.\NI’m the real Yumi.
ODD: Yeah right, you expect me to fall for that old one!\NOn three, we pulverize you.
1, 2, 3
YUMI: Jeremie, you’ve gotta wake up.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, hurry up.\NAelita’s hardly got any memory left.
ULRICH: Drop her, fishface!
You okay Aelita?
JEREMIE: Aelita?
AELITA: {\i1}I’m… I’m okay.
ODD: Well I’m not feeling so great.
 JEREMIE: Aelita, quick!
DEFAULT: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
AELITA: Tower deactivated.
YOLANDA: That’s very sweet of you Jim,\Nbut as I already told you I’m engaged to be married.
JIM: But if that’s true Yolanda,\Nuhh why’d you kiss me?
YOLANDA: I, kissed you?
You should get some rest Jim.
Now be a good boy,\Nand let me take your temperature, alright?
YUMI: How did you guess I was the real Yumi?
ODD: Because you called me peabrain,\NXana would never call me that.
He’s got too much… respect for me.
JEREMIE: Oh no, Xana just doesn’t know you\Nas well as Yumi does.
AELITA: Jeremie,\Nwould you come with me for a minute?
I’d like to check something, you mind?
JEREMIE: No, go ahead.\NCheck what?
AELITA: I knew it.
ODD: Uhh, Jeremie come back to Earth.
Let’s hope that XANA leaves us alone for a little while.
I think Jeremie’s gonna need\Nsome time to get over that one, huh guys?
