ULRICH: Huh three day weekend, \Nthat’s fantastic. Isn’t it?
YUMI: With a little luck, I just may have the house to myself.
JEREMIE: Yeah, but knowing your parents\Nit’s not going to be easy.
ODD: I’m betting on Yumi.
YUMI: I didn’t tell you, but I’ve got a lot \Nof homework this weekend.
Of course I’ll stay home and look after things.
And if you’ve nothing against it,\NI’d like to have a little gathering.
MR ISHIYAMA: Gathering to do homework together,\Nor to wreck the living room?
YUMI: Well… uh...
MRS ISHIYAMA: Go on answer your father.
YUMI: Well I thought I’d invite my friends over for a quiet evening at home.
MR ISHIYAMA: Hmm… \NYou mean those three clowns?
YUMI: But daddy! You hardly\Neven know them!
MRS ISHIYAMA: They seem nice enough.
YUMI: I wish you’d trust me a little more.
MR ISHIYAMA: Hm…
Alright!
They can come.
YUMI: That is so great!
You won’t regret it. You’ll see!
Thanks mom.
You are the greatest!\NHave a nice weekend!
Hey I’ve got great news guys,\Ntonight we have the house all to ourselves.
ULRICH: You did it!
YUMI: We better get organized.
ULRICH: No problem.
YUMI: Anything wrong, Jeremie?
JEREMIE: I’m trying to localize Lyoko,\Nit shouldn’t take this much time.
YUMI: Don’t worry!
If there is a problem,\NAelita will contact you.
JEREMIE: Yeah well,\Nwe can always hope.
DEFAULT: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
JEREMIE: Time for physics!
DEFAULT: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)\NMRS. HERTZ: Hm. Class dismissed.
And don’t forget Monday’s quiz\Non seismic phenomenon better known as earthquakes.
ULRICH: Theo and Benjamin said they would come,\NBut what are we gonna do about Sissi?
Wouldn’t break my heart if she didn’t come.\NShe and that horrible music she’d bring with her.
ODD: Hey, leave the music to me.\NWait till you see the surprise I’ve got in store for you.
We’re gonna have a real DJ, guys.\NYou’ll see, no dumb music for us, we’re gonna rock.
YUMI: Great, see ya later,\NWe’ll go shopping after class.
JEREMIE: Ok, in the meantime I’ll try and contact \NAelita and warn her to be careful tonight. You never know.
ODD: And now it’s time for Ulrich to get ready and enter the starting block.
Tensions are high, ladies and gentlemen, \Nas he zeros in on his objective.
The timekeeper is about to signal the departure.
JEREMIE: Bang!
ODD: And he’s off and running!
What grace! What agility! And what great speed he’s got!
And here we go, he’s ready for the sliding phase!
With perfect knee coordination!
Ready?
Stop!
Oh, he beat me.
YUMI: Really? Ulrich went farther than you?
ULRICH: Well then, how did I make out?
JEREMIE: A new dorm record!
JIM: What’s all this racket about?
(GROWLING)
ODD: Gotta hang up!\NSecret code Big-Fat-Clown
YUMI: Gotcha, ok, talk to you later.
ULRICH: Come on, Jim, we’re just a little bored,\Nthere’s nothing to do here.
JIM: I really don’t understand, every long weekend, you kids stay at school, you never go anywhere!
If for once you guys took a vacation, I’d have some peace and quiet!
ODD: That just goes to show how much we love this place.
JIM: Oh yeah? I bet that’s cause at home your parents are sick of ya!
I sympathise with them.
And now, let’s go, I want all of you to\Ngo back to your rooms on the double!
DEFAULT: Awww
ULRICH: Right away, Jim.
Your turn, Odd.
ODD: We’d better hurry, huh?
JEREMIE: Bang!
You ok, Odd?
ODD: Hey didn’t I beat the record?
ULRICH: Is this your surprise disc-jockey? Huh?
ODD: Yeah-you mean you don’t recognize her? \NShe goes to school here, her name’s Samantha.
Uh see ya later, I’ve got some work to do.
ULRICH: Hm, you're not going to introduce us to her?
ODD: That must be her. 
Hello?
JEREMIE: I don’t believe it, that’s the fifth\Ntime I’ve launched the localization program.
The network must really be blocked, \NI can’t into contact with Lyoko.
ODD: Uh, hello?
SAMANTHA: Hi.
ODD: How are you?
Did you have any trouble getting in?
SAMANTHA: No, no trouble, the gates were really easy to climb.
ODD: When can you show me what you’re gonna do?
SAMANTHA: When I’m finished, I wanna add a little \Nmore stuff, but I haven’t found anything I like yet.
ODD: You should try the old vinyl records, \Nthere’s lots of really great stuff on vinyl.
If you want, I’ll lend you some.
SAMANTHA: Can’t we stop talking about music?\NWe’ve got better things to do, don’t you think?
Ready for a big thrill session?
ODD: Uh, yeah I guess.
SAMANTHA: Well, then take me to the computer room, Odd.
JEREMIE: I think this time I’ve got it!
One more operation and--\NAelita? Aelita, it’s Jeremie! Do you read me, Aelita?
Hey, Aelita!
AELITA: {\i1}Hello Jeremie. How are you?
JEREMIE: Eh, So-so--
AELITA:  {\i1}Why? What’s wrong?
JEREMIE: I had such a tough time contacting Lyoko!
AELITA:  {\i1}That’s nothing new. Lyoko is constantly\Nchanging its access points on the network.
ULRICH: Hey, you feel like playing some chess?
JEREMIE: Be right there.
SAMANTHA: Wow, what kind of powers this one got?
ODD: Oh, I dunno, two gigas?
Hey, cut that out! Put that down, you here?\NWhat are you doing?
SAMANTHA: If I’m gonna make music, I need a powerful computer, but I’m broke, so I have no choice but to rip this one off.
Your school’s insured, so everybody's happy, right?
ODD: Wrong! Insurance or not, stealing’s a crime!
And besides, nobody--\NDoes that around here.
SAMANTHA: Hey, you’re r--\NODD: Shhh!
JIM: Hmm?
I would never have believed it of you, Odd.
ODD: I wasn't going to steal it, Jim, I swear!
JIM: Huh, what were you gonna do with it, then?
ODD: Uh.
JIM: You've got some explaining to do, follow me.
JEREMIE: Checkmate!
ULRICH: Can I maybe try beating you at--\NLike, karate?
JIM: Go on, keep moving.
ULRICH: Looks like trouble.
JIM: Well, Odd,  this time you are in one \Nheck of a jam, that’s for sure, kid.
Caught in the act stealing a computer that is school \Nproperty isn’t like not doing your homework.
JEREMIE: Listen Jim!\NJIM: What the?
JEREMIE: This is crazy, whenever Odd needs a\Ncomputer, I lend him mine, I’ve done it lots of times.
Go on, tell him, Odd.
ODD: Yeah, although, this time I needed a really \Npowerful laptop, and that one was just perfect.
JIM: And why didn’t you ask permission to borrow it?
It seems to me that would have been a lot more simple.
ODD: Well, I was afraid that you would say no.
JIM: What do you think I am? An idiot?\NI want the truth right now.
You stole it, didn’t you?
This time it’s the school disciplinary council, \Nand you might just get expelled!
ODD: Huh? No wait, you can’t do that to me, Jim!
DEFAULT: (PHONE RINGS)
JIM: The use of cell phones is strictly forbidden on school grounds!
Hand it over, Confiscated!
AELITA: Jeremie! Jeremie!\NI just spotted an activated tower.
Jeremie, Xana’s launched an attack.\NJeremie, answer me!
SAMANTHA: Gotta get outta here.
Huh?
JEREMIE: Ok, tell us what happened, come on Odd.
ODD: I’ve got nothing else to say.\NSee you later, I got things to do.
Alone!
Do you see what I see?
Xana!
JEREMIE: Hey, they’re getting really deep,\Neverything’s gonna be swallowed up.
DEFAULT: (PHONE RINGS)
YUMI: Ok, I’ll see you at the factory.
ODD: Hold it!
Look, I can’t go with you now, Samantha’s\Nlocked in the science building’s computer room.
JEREMIE: Ok, let’s go back to the beginning,\Ncause I think you lost us, Odd.
ODD: She’s the one who stole the computer.
I really tried to stop he, but--
Well, she’s already got a lot of problems \Nat her school, so I didn’t tell Jim.
ULRICH: No matter what happened, we gotta get her outta there.
JEREMIE: Right, I’ll run over and meet Yumi at the lab.
ULRICH: Ok, step number one, we pay a visit to the gymnasium.
Let’s hope we’re the only ones at school.
Must be in here.
Bingo!
ODD: So which way do we go now?
ULRICH: There!
SAMANTHA: Oh no, I don’t believe it, I’m never going to get out of here! 
ODD: It’s at least a twenty metre drop down there.
ULRICH: Well, make sure the rope is attached securely.
YUMI: What’s going on?
JEREMIE: Connection!
DEFAULT:  {\i1}Connecting to Lyoko!
AELITA:  {\i1}Jeremie! You're there, at last!\NXana’s activated a tower!
JEREMIE: That’s what we thought, we’ve already been affected.
ODD: Take your time and concentrate.
ULRICH: Go!
Ok, here we go.

ODD: Samantha! Sam, we’re on our way!
Don’t worry Sam, we’re gonna get you out.
Are you ok? It’s over now, Sam.
SAMANTHA: Oh Odd, I’m sorry.
ULRICH: I hate to bother you guys, but we’ve \Ngotta get outta here, and fast, too!
AELITA: Yumi, your hand, give me your hand.
YUMI: Thank you, Aelita, you got here just in time.
AELITA: Now we’ve got to hurry, Xana’s monsters \Naren’t here yet but they’re bound to come.
The tower’s not far from here, in that direction.
YUMI: Well, this promises to be a charming stroll.
AELITA: It’s not as hard as all that, if you jump at the right time.
YUMI: I see what you mean.
AELITA: Ready?
JIM: 46, 47, 48, 49--\NWhat’s going on?
AELITA: We’re almost there. 
YUMI: You were right, Aelita, it wasn’t all that hard.
JEREMIE:  {\i1}Watch out, three hornets approaching fast!
YUMI: Stay behind me.
JEREMIE:  {\i1}They’ve disappeared from my control screen.
YUMI: Where did they go?
AELITA: I don't know. In this territory, they have the advantage.
JIM: Can you hear me? Listen I’m calling from the junior-highschool.
I work here at the school and I need your help.
Listen it’s a real emergency, I’m stuck in a\Ncloset with tons of mud, so get here fast!
No, lady, this is not a practical joke!
No, I can’t wait any longer!
 {\i1}Help me!
JEREMIE:  {\i1}Yumi, the hornets are coming straight at you!
YUMI: Jeremie, I’m caught in a crossfire, I can’t hold out much longer!
JEREMIE: Hang on, Odd and Ulrich are on the way!
I hope so, anyway.
YUMI: Aelita!
JEREMIE: Yumi No!
Try using your creativity, Aelita, we need a little time!
SAMANTHA: Wow, this place is wild, what is it?
JEREMIE: Huh, you’re finally here!
Yumi’s been devirtualized, Aelita’s fighting three hornets all alone!
SAMANTHA: Odd, I don't understand any of this.\NWhat’s going on, huh?
ODD: Sorry, there’s no time to explain, you keep\NJeremie company, and I’ll see you later.
SAMANTHA: What?
