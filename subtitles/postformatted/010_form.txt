JEREMIE: Time to launch the program.
JEREMIE: Oh no, I don’t believe it, not again!
JEREMIE: I- Darn it, I’m so useless, I’m never gonna do it!
AELITA: {/i1}And I’m sure you will Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Thanks for the encouragement,\NBut I’m useless I tell you.
AELITA: {/i1}Jeremie, do you think we’d get along well\Nin the real world?
AELITA: I mean, as well as we do now?
JEREMIE: Yeah, of course, why?
AELITA: {/i1}Well because I’m not so sure\NI’d like to have a best friend who’s useless.
AELITA: You understand?
JEREMIE: Ha ha, very funny.
ODD: Hey get a move on Jeremie,\Nyou’re going to be late for school again.
JEREMIE: Wow is it that late already?\NOk I’ll be right there Odd.
JEREMIE: Anyhow useless or not I’m going to try one more thing.
ODD: Ok I get the picture, see you later.
AELITA: (SCREAMS)
ULRICH: This whatever it is of yours weighs at least a ton!
YUMI: It's not a whatever,\Nit’s been in my family for hundreds of years.
ULRICH: So when are you going to unveil your thingamabob?
YUMI: At the very end of my report.\NYou’ll see it's gonna be smash hit, a real showstopper!
YUMI: Worth an A I hope.
ULRICH: Well you sure wouldn’t find a thing like that at my house.
ULRICH: First of all your whatchamacallit\Ndoesn’t go with the drapes in the living room.
YUMI: Whatchamacallit? Whatever?\NWhat I like most about you Ulrich is your rich vocabulary.
MILLY: Don’t look now Tamiya, but I smell a big juicy scoop!
TAMIYA: So do I!
TAMIYA: Ok, rolling, go ahead.
MILLY: Fellow middle school students, hello, this is Milly\Nand Tamiya of the seventh grade reporting the school news.
MILLY: You may not know it, but just behind your backs,\Nsomething strange is hatching,
MILLY: and this my friends, is a part of it.
MILLY: In our constant quest\Nto be the first to report the latest news,
MILLY: we are bringing you this exclusive expose\Nof what's hidden under this drape.
MILLY: Tamiya, listen,\Nis there any reason for your filming your feet?
MILLY: Hey, Tamiya!
TAMIYA: I’m sorry, it scares me a little.
MILLY: Oh no, time for class already?
JEREMIE: (YAWNS)
ULRICH: You know Jeremie most people use the night hours to sleep.
JEREMIE: I was trying a new program for materializing Aelita.
JEREMIE: With this last one I was trying I almost succeeded,\NI was nearly there.
ODD: And what are you going to say to her when you do succeed?
ODD: You never knew how to talk to a girl!
JEREMIE: With Aelita, it's not the same.
ODD: You’re right it's not the same.
MR. DELMAS: Good morning everyone.
MR. DELMAS: Before the start of your first class this morning,\NI would like to introduce your new classmate.
MR. DELMAS: Come in Taelia, I’m sure your fellow students are anxious\Nto meet you.
ODD: Okay here’s your chance, imagine she’s here in front of you,\Nright now in flesh and blood, what are you going to say?
JEREMIE: Oh wow! (STAMMERS)
ODD: Beep! Sorry your time is up!\NYou could do with a few pointers in flirting.
ODD: Oh wow, this is- I don’t believe it!
YUMI: You’re right, she sure does look like her,
YUMI: but if it really is her,\Nshe ought to be able to recognize us don’t you think?
JEREMIE: Not necessarily, she may\Nof lost her memory when she was materialized.
ODD: Well talk to her,\Nit's the only way you can find out.
JEREMIE: What if it's not her?
ODD: Hm?
Ulrich: Hm.
ODD: (SIGHS)
ODD: Go on!
JEREMIE: Hey! Wait- (STAMMERS)
ODD: Okay watch an expert at work, and learn.
ODD: Hi there Ae- I mean Taelia.
ODD: My friends and I were, uh,\Nwe thought you looked familiar like we’d seen you before.
TAELIA: Come on, that’s the oldest pick up line around.
ODD: Huh? Hey who said that I wanted to pick you up?\NI was just making conversation.
ODD: Uh, by the way do things like the virtual world, or Krabs,\Nor buzzing monsters mean anything to you?
TAELIA: Uh, well yeah.\NIt means that I'd better be moving along.
JEREMIE: Hey wait a minute, don’t go!
JEREMIE: Where are you from? Do you have a family?
TAELIA: I’m not in the mood to talk.
YUMI: Well?
ODD: It’s not her.
ULRICH: He’s only saying that\Nbecause he just got the brush off big time!
ULRICH: Watch an expert learn huh?
ULRICH: Anyway if it is Aelita, its for sure she’s got amnesia.
JEREMIE: Wait a second, hold on.
JEREMIE: Lets say its her, if it's really her, I mean for sure,\NThen she can’t still be on Lyoko!
ULRICH: You can check it out later.\NRight now we have a date with Mrs. Meyer.
YUMI: Wish me luck for my report everybody!
YUMI: Thanks for caring, guys...
MRS. MEYER: Now we have here a simple equation with two unknowns-
JEREMIE: I have to check out Lyoko now, I can’t wait any longer!
ODD: Okay, we’ll go together.
JEREMIE: Uh, Mrs. Meyer, excuse me?
MRS. MEYER: Yes, what is it?
JEREMIE: I’m sorry but I need to go to the infirmary.\NI don’t feel too well, I feel uh- I feel really sick.
MRS. MEYER: Yes, of course, Jeremie, go ahead.
ODD: Uh, I’ll take him there! I mean uh, you never know, huh?
JEREMIE: We’re just about connected.
ODD: Jim’s going to catch us if you don’t hurry up.
JEREMIE: Aelita do you read me? It’s Jeremie, Aelita.
ODD: She doesn’t answer but she might be in one of Xana’s traps,\Nlike in a storm or snow bound, so you can’t pick her up.
JEREMIE: What if the last calculations I tried were the right ones?
ODD: You know, you could really use a good night's sleep.
JEREMIE: Odd, it’s her.
ODD: And I say you’re nuts!
JEREMIE: I’m positive, I did it, I did, Taelia is Aelita!
YUMI: Well, of course it’s just a glimpse of my country's culture.
YUMI: To explain it all would take me hours, and I’m not sure\Nyou’re ready to put up with me for that long right?
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
YUMI: To end my report, I’d like to show you something\Nthat’s been in my family for centuries.
YUMI: It’s a living symbol of Japan,\Nand it's a- (STAMMERS) a drape?
YUMI: Xana.
JIM: Hey you! What are you doing here? Huh?\NWhat kind of a costume is that?
JIM: Huh?
JIM: Hey, what wrong with you, huh?
JIM: Are you out of your head?
ULRICH: Maybe one of the kids took it?
YUMI: Don’t forget the electric plugs!
ODD: Yeah, look if Xana is in on this,\Nwe better not count on Aelita. We can’t reach her on Lyoko.
JEREMIE: Odd we can’t reach her on Lyoko\N'cause she isn’t on Lyoko!
YUMI: Hm?
TAELIA: Hm?
YUMI: Sorry you guys, but I can’t believe\Nthat that that girl is Aelita.
ULRICH: Well I know somebody who's dying to believe it.
MR. DELMAS: Children please give me your attention.
MR. DELMAS: Several of your fellow students as well as our own Jim,\Nwhom you all know, and whom you respect I know,
MR. DELMAS: have been attacked.
ODD: Let’s not go overboard, huh?
MR. DELMAS: Their attacker was a person who uh,\Nwell a person who was wearing armor, the armor of a Samurai.
MR. DELMAS: (CLEARS THROAT) And this individual is still at large.
YUMI: (SIGHS)
MR. DELMAS: Any information you can contribute to the police\Nwould be more than welcome.
YUMI: We can't wait any longer.
ULRICH: We have to go to Lyoko, find Aelita,\Nand deactivate the tower.
JEREMIE: When are you gonna get it into your thick heads that if\Nthe samurai is controlled by Xana, that he's after Taelia?
JEREMIE: It makes sense, doesn't it? Huh?
JEREMIE: Because Taelia is Aelita. (SIGHS)
ODD: Wow, he's really flipped his lid, huh?
DEFAULT: Excuse me, Miss.
DEFAULT: It seems that this armor belongs to you.
YUMI: (STAMMERS)
JEREMIE: Aelita! Listen to me, Xana's launched a new virus.
TAELIA: (SIGHS)
JEREMIE: He's managed to take control of a samurai's armor.
JEREMIE: You're his sworn enemy. He's after you.
JEREMIE: You have no choice, you absolutely have to hide.
TAELIA: As a pick up line, that's a lot more original\Nthan the one your friend tried.
JEREMIE: Aelita, please listen to me.
JEREMIE: It's definitely the materialization that gave you amnesia.\NThe shock made you lose your memory.
JEREMIE: But you have to trust me! You have to, Aelita.
TAELIA: Hey, get your hands off of me.\NI don't trust anyone who's stark raving mad.
JEREMIE: (GASPS)
SFX: (FOOTSTEPS)
TAELIA: (GASPS)
JEREMIE: (GASPS)
JEREMIE: No Xana! You won't get her, I won't let you, you hear?
TAELIA: (GASPS)
JEREMIE: Come on, follow me! Hurry!
JEREMIE: Faster, Taelita!
TAELIA: (GASPS)
YUMI: It's not true.
DEFAULT: Anyway, this samurai's armor does belong to you?
YUMI: Well yes, to my parents.
DEFAULT: And you have no idea who might have stolen it?
ODD: Look, we can't do anything here for Yumi, Ulrich,\Nwe have to tell Jeremie to meet us at the factory.
ULRICH: Jeremie's voice-mail is on now.
TAELIA: Wow, this place is weird.
JEREMIE: Follow me.
JEREMIE: Come on.
JEREMIE: That's Lyoko.
JEREMIE: The virtual world where you once lived.
JEREMIE: Doesn't that ring a bell at all?
TAELIA: And this, um, this Xana you talked about,\Ndoes he also live in the same world?
JEREMIE: Yes.
JEREMIE: He's got total control.
TAELIA: But if he's so dangerous, why don't you destroy Lyoko?
JEREMIE: Because you're part of-\N(STAMMERS) Because you were part of this world.
TAELIA: You're totally crazy.
JEREMIE: (SIGHS)
TAELIA: This whole story is crazy.
TAELIA: You know what I think? If all this stuff is so dangerous,\Nit's time you destroyed it, once and for all.
JEREMIE: Do you... do you really think so?
TAELIA: Mh hm.
JEREMIE: (SIGHS)
ULRICH: Jeremie, stop.
JEREMIE: Huh?
ODD: Have you gone mad or what, Einstein?\NWhat if Aelita is still on Lyoko?
JEREMIE: But she isn't, I tell you.\NLook, she's there, she's right in front of you.
ULRICH: Jeremie, I know you've dreamt of\Nseeing Aelita in reality for months,
ULRICH: but please come down to Earth, you can't be sure.
ULRICH: And what if you were mistaken?
ODD: You mean you're ready to take the risk of destroying Aelita\Nby destroying Xana, huh?
ULRICH: We've got to make sure.
ULRICH: You've got to let us go to Lyoko.
JEREMIE: And if Aelita's not there,\Nwho's going to deactivate the tower?
ULRICH: We have to take the risk.
TAELIA: Huh?
JEREMIE: {\i1}The last time I saw Aelita,{\i0}\Nshe was in the mountain area.
JEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Scanner{\i0} Ulrich.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Scanner Odd.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Can you see anything?
ULRICH: Yes, Jeremie. Mountains, lot's of 'em.
JEREMIE: I'm starting the scan\Nto trace the tower that Xana activated.
JEREMIE: You have to understand Taelia,\Nif you're not Aelita, then we've got to- Taelia?
ODD: Boy oh boy, finding someone around here is gonna be\Nharder than finding an idea in Jim's head.
ODD: Huh?
ODD: (SIGHS)
ODD: Ulrich, I just saw Aelita.
ULRICH: Hm? Where?
ODD: In a kind of flash vision.
JEREMIE: Aelita.
JEREMIE: Oh, hi, Yumi.
JEREMIE: Well, is everything okay?
YUMI: Yes, they finished questioning me,
YUMI: but I just saw Taelia, and she looked like she\Nwas in a hurry to go and see the principal.
JEREMIE: Oh, that can't be, this is awful, horrible.\NYumi, I took Taelia to the factory.
YUMI: You what? She's gonna tell the cops everything!\NBe right there.
JEREMIE: (MOANS)
JEREMIE: Odd, Ulrich, the tower Xana's activated has been localized\Nat thirty degrees north in- in the forest area.
ULRICH: Without Aelita, that's not gonna do us a lot of good.
ODD: Look there! That ball of fire.
ODD: That's exactly what I saw before. Aelita's inside it.
ODD: (YELLS)
ODD: (GRUNTS)
ULRICH: {\i1}Jeremie, we found her!
JEREMIE: (SIGHS)
ODD: That ball is what's blocking the communication with Aelita.
ULRICH: It's a Guardian, the same monster that imprisoned Yumi.
ODD: Right, and Aelita saved her by convincing the monster\Nhe had the wrong prisoner.
ULRICH: Yeah, but Aelita is the prisoner this time.\NSo now, the only solution is to use force.
ULRICH: (GRUNTS)
YUMI: (GASPS)
YUMI: Is anyone there?
YUMI: I know you're there! Show yourself!
ULRICH: (GRUNTS)
ODD: Laser arrow!
ODD: Jeremie, nothing's working.
ULRICH: {\i1}It's like this machine's invincible.
JEREMIE: (SIGHS) Wow, Xana has- Xana must have designed a program...\Nright, it's a program.
JEREMIE: And if it's a program, I should be able to-
ULRICH: Hey, what are you mumbling about?\NYou've got an idea, I hope?
JEREMIE: {\i1}Maybe, but give me a couple minutes here.
ODD: Okay, no problem, man, we've got all the time in the world.
JEREMIE: (SIGHS)
YUMI: (GASPS)
YUMI: (GRUNTS)
JEREMIE: Already? To think I blew our whole cover\Nby talking to a perfect stranger.
JEREMIE: That means the samurai wasn't after Taelia at all,\Nhe was after us. Yumi!
JEREMIE: Just a little more time.
ULRICH: {\i1}Hey, how about that idea of yours?
JEREMIE: It's ready. Here goes.
ODD: Making a clone of Aelita?
ODD: Well personally, I'm a bit skeptical, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Patience, Odd.
ULRICH: A decoy! Jeremie, you're the greatest.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Get Aelita to a tower,\Nshe's got to regenerate herself.
JEREMIE: Everything's okay, Aelita's got her life points back again.
AELITA: (SIGHS) You found me at last.
AELITA: What about the Guardian?
ODD: You mean that big, fat fire bubble?\NHa, he won't bother you anymore.
ODD: We're off Jeremie. Destination, the forest.
ULRICH: Jeremie, we're here.
JEREMIE: Look guys, you better hurry, I {\i1}can't reach Yumi.\NI'm afraid she's having problems with the samurai.
ULRICH: There's no time to lose, let's go.
ODD: While you're at it, you got any other good news?
JEREMIE: {\i1}Oh yeah, plenty.
JEREMIE: Taelia saw me punch in the access code to the lab,\Nand the principal and the police are here now.
JEREMIE: Um, and Xana's monsters are around.
JEREMIE: Two Bloks.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Watch out for their laser gel[a] guns, or it's game over.
ODD: Hey, Bloks, cool, my favorite monsters.
ODD: Laser arrow.
JEREMIE: (SIGHS)
TAELIA: There, it was this computer right here.
TAELIA: There was this Xana thing, I don't know how,\Nbut it seems he wants to destroy the planet.
MR. DELMAS: Jeremie, I think you owe us an explanation.
ULRICH: Odd, take care of Aelita.\NI'll stay here and cover you. Alone. Well, almost alone.
ULRICH: Triangulate.
ULRICH: Impact.
ODD: Your turn, Princess.
MR. DELMAS: Come along now.
JEREMIE: I'm sorry sir, but my friends are in danger\Nand I can't abandon them.
JEREMIE: No, don't! Stop!
JEREMIE: You can't do this, let me go!
ODD: You always pick the wrong time, huh?
ODD: Now!
SFX: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
YUMI: (GASPS)
YUMI: Oh no!
YUMI: (SIGHS)
JEREMIE: Return to the past now!
MR. DELMAS: And this is Taelia, your new classmate.\NI'm sure your fellow students are anxious to meet you.
ULRICH: I heard Sissi say that the new girl was an orphan.\NThat's why she didn't want to talk about her family.
JEREMIE: Well anyway, if you look closely,\Nyou can see their eyes aren't the same.
JEREMIE: The nose is different, and so is the hair,\Nthey're not similar at all.
JEREMIE: How could you have possibly thought she was Aelita?
ULRICH: Did you just say that we thought?
ODD: You sure did.
JEREMIE: You'd have to be blind to think that.
YUMI: And now, to finish my report, I'd like to show you something\Nthat's been in my family for centuries.
YUMI: It's a living symbol of Japan. Here.
