JEREMIE: Come on, come on!
Ugh, I- I’m so darn lame!
ULRICH: Hi, Einstein.
YUMI: Hey.
You look awfully down today, what’s the problem?
JEREMIE: I’ve been spinning my wheels for days now on Aelita’s antivirus and\Ntrying to decode Franz Hopper’s diary.
YUMI: Just a question of time.
JEREMIE: You think so?
Even with the latest data we got from Sector Five,\NI haven’t moved ahead one micron! What if I’m just…
...just not good enough?
ULRICH: Uh, okay, I think I know someone who needs to air out his neurons a little.
And here’s how to do it. Tonight,\NOdd is screening his short film.
JEREMIE: Anyone seen any of it?
YUMI: He wouldn’t let us?
JEREMIE: Do we know who’s in it, at least?
SISSI: Humbly speaking, I don’t think it’s unfair to say that this first role will reveal\Nto the entire world my true star personality.
MILLY: Can you sum up the story for us in just a few words for the Kadic News?
SISSI: Oh, well, that is, uh, it’s a love story, and at the same time, it’s a thriller!\NWith suspense, and of course, it’s got a good dose of psychology,
and- and- and it’s very funny, a real comedy, and, uh, quite satirical.
MILLY: So you have no idea?
SISSI: Uh, I gotta go, someone’s calling me!
DEFAULT: (GIGGLING)
GUSTAVE: Welcome to the Kadic Academy cinema club’s short film night!
Charlie Chaplin, Ziga Cerkov--
ULRICH: How’s it going, Odd? No butterflies yet?
ODD: No, I’m- I’m- I’m cool.
ULRICH: You’d never guess.
GUSTAVE: ...to full-length features, which is also why I’ll be…
HERB: Relax, I’m sure you’re gonna be great.
SISSI: Thanks, that’s sweet. But, uh, move your hand or lose it at the elbow.
GUSTAVE: ...the short film is, was, and always will be an important art form,\Nwhich can say as much as a full-length feature.
Our first film is by Odd Della-Robbia, and is entitled, rather poetically,\N“Natural Grandeur”. No one has seen it yet, but it isn’t hard to imagine
a project, perhaps, of the fragility of our ecosystem, which- er--
SISSI: Hmph.
JIM: Hmhm.
MR. DELMAS: Hmm.
ODD: {/i1}Help! Help! She’s awake, oh no!
STUDENT: {/i1}What’s all this racket about, huh?
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
JIM: Ahahaha- oh?
ODD: {/i1}We have to get out of here! She- she- \Nshe’s coming! I tell you, she’s as big as her ego!
STUDENT: {/i1}That’s impossible! \NYou know how big that would make her.
SISSI: Hmm.
STUDENT: {/i1}I think you’ve lost your senses.
SISSI: Hmm.
STUDENT: {/i1}Alright, let’s go to the infirmary.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
ODD: {/i1}No!
DEFAULT: {/i1}Huh?
ODD: {/i1}It’s too late! She’s found us!
SISSI: Huh?
{/i1}Oh rats, I just broke a nail!
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
HERB: I didn’t know you could be so funny.
DEFAULT: {/i1}Aaah!
SISSI: Odd! You’re nothing but a- you’re nothing but a…
(GIBBERISH)
MR. DELMAS: Is something wrong, sweetheart?
SISSI: (GIBBERISH)
JIM: I’ll take care of this, Mr. Delmas.
I think you’ve lost your senses. Alright, let’s go to the infirmary.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
MR. DELMAS: Alright, children, I want each of you to go quietly back to your rooms.\NJim, take care of the students. I’ll take Sissi to the infirmary.
YUMI: You think it’s…\N...XANA?
JEREMIE: Nope. No activated towers. XANA’s got nothing to do with it.
YUMI: The nurse said that Sissi received an electric charge.\NShe’s in shock, but fine, there’s nothing to worry about.
ODD: Oh poor Sissi. I have to admit that her acting was really electrifying .
JEREMIE: Right. False alarm. We can all sleep easy now.
ULRICH: Yeah, that works out just fine, because tomorrow is Sunday, and on Sunday--
ODD: --we sleep in!
JEREMIE: Huh?
Huh?
SISSI: (GIBBERISH)
JEREMIE: Sissi!
SISSI: (GIBBERISH)
JEREMIE: Sissi, what has gotten into you, huh?
JIM: What’s all this racket about? 
Sissi? You should be in the infirmary,\Nyour father’s going to have my head again.
SFX: (PHONE RINGING)
ULRICH: Jeremie, it’s Sunday…
Okay, we’re coming.
A message in code? Written by Sissi?
JEREMIE: Uh-huh. I ran the Supercomputer all night to translate it.
And look at what it turned up!
DEFAULT: (GIBBERISH)
...I can help you. I want to enter into contact with you.
YUMI: “I can help you”?
ULRICH: It has to be a trap by XANA. He must’ve managed somehow to possess Sissi\Nwithout activating a tower.
AELITA: I don’t think so. Otherwise, \NSissi would have gone after me.
She would’ve tried to get me out to Lyoko,\Nso that the Scyphozoa could
steal my memory.
JEREMIE: Aelita’s right. If you ask me, someone - or something -\Nwants to contact us through Sissi, but it’s not XANA.
ODD: Well then, who is it?
JEREMIE: No idea. To find that out,\Nwe’ll have to talk to Sissi again.
YUMI: Okay, I’ll bring her over. Anyone care to join me?
ODD: I will. I’m your man, Yumi. I mean- you know what I mean.
ULRICH: I’d better go take a look around Lyoko.\NI still wanna make sure XANA isn’t setting some sort of trap.
AELITA: I’ll go with you.
JEREMIE: With the Scyphozoa and everything? It’s too risky.
AELITA: Jeremie, stop worrying about me.
JEREMIE: {/i1}Transfer, Ulrich.\NTransfer, Aelita
{/i1}Scanner, Ulrich{i0}\NScanner, Aelita
{/i1}Virtualization
ULRICH: Great timing. Nice work, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Thanks.\NOkay, make it fast, it’s just a reconnaissance mission.
ULRICH: We know. Relax, we won’t go crazy.
ODD: Yeah!
Jeremie, bad news. Sissi’s going to the hospital.
JEREMIE: Oh no, we have to bring her back here!
ODD: No sweat, I’ve got an idea.
YUMI: Are you thinking what I think you’re thinking?
ODD: Yeah. good thinking.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, Aelita, everything okay with you guys?
ULRICH: To tell you the truth, I have no idea. \NHas the Superscan picked up an activated tower?
JEREMIE: No, still nothing, why?
AELITA: {/i1}Well… hang on, I’ll send you a visual.
JEREMIE: What the heck is this white tower supposed to mean?
ULRICH: {/i1}I was about to ask you the same thing.
Do you think this tower has something to do with Sissi?\NOr with the being that’s trying to contact us?
JEREMIE: {/i1}I don’t know.
AELITA: Come on, I’d like to see this close up.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, behind you!
AELITA: Faster!
ULRICH: I’ve got it floored!
AELITA: Turn left!
ULRICH: Woah, are you sure? There’s nothing to the left!
AELITA: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
JEREMIE: Well done Aelita,\Nbut it’s really weird that they didn’t come back to attack you.
{/i1}Something’s not right.
AELITA: Jeremie, it wasn’t us they were after.
ULRICH They’re trying to destroy the white tower!
JEREMIE: Hold them off.
ULRICH: Feel like a little game of bowling?
AELITA: Of what?
JEREMIE: {/i1}Forget about it, it’s a bad joke.
ULRICH: Sometimes, I really crack myself up.
MR. DELMAS: Well, what’s wrong with her?
NURSE: I haven’t the slightest idea.
We’ll keep her here under observation\Nfor a few hours, and then we’ll see.
MR. DELMAS: Oh, very well.\NLet me know at the first sign of a change in her condition.
NURSE: Of course.
DOCTOR: ...such a sweet patient, he was really lucky…
ODD: So what did the girl at the reception say?
YUMI: Room 237.
JEREMIE: Huh?
DEFAULT: (PHONE RINGING)
YUMI: Jeremie?
JEREMIE: I’ve just located an activated tower. XANA is on the offensive!
SISSI: (SCREAMING)
YUMI: Jeremie, I’ll call you back.
Stop!
ODD: Poor thing. She had hypertension.
YUMI: Not anymore. Quick!
It’s okay, Jeremie, we’ve got Sissi.
JEREMIE: Great! Bring her over to the factory and hurry up!
YUMI: {/i1}It won’t be that easy.{i0}\NThere’s a doctor possessed by XANA who doesn’t seem to like the idea.
JEREMIE: Ouch.
Ulrich, I’ve got some bad news.
ULRICH: Hang on.
So, Jeremie, what were you saying?
JEREMIE: {/i1}Activated tower in the ice sector.
ULRICH: What should I do with Aelita? Protect this tower or deactivate the other one?
AELITA: Ulrich!
ULRICH: Huh?
{/i1}Jeremie, what do we do?
JEREMIE: Uh, protect the white tower!
AELITA: You know, I could go deactivate that tower.
JEREMIE: All alone? No way. It’s too dangerous.
ULRICH: I’ll get rid of this one, and after that, we’ll go together.
AELITA: Look!
ULRICH: Aelita, stay next to me.
JEREMIE: No, Aelita, don’t do it!
ODD: Let’s get out of here!\NHere comes Doctor Doom!
YUMI: Look out!
ODD: I hope she was wearing a seatbelt.
ULRICH: Huh?
Cool.
ODD: Phew.
JEREMIE: {/i1}Ulrich?
ULRICH: Relax, Jeremie, I’m on it.
That has got to hurt.
Woah.
YUMI: Quick!
JEREMIE: Ah, finally.
ODD: Yumi, what are you doing?
YUMI: I’m buying time.
JEREMIE: Sissi, I believe that-- h-hey!
ODD: Sissi, now what’s the matter with you?
JEREMIE: Wait. Let her go.
Aelita, look out!
Get to Lyoko! Quick!
ULRICH: Jeremie, I can’t hold out much longe- aaah!
JEREMIE: Sissi!
Virtualization!
AELITA: Odd!
ODD: Run, Aelita! Run!
JEREMIE: Odd, watch it, you’ve just lost 80 life points.\NOne more hit and it’s game over!
ODD: {/i1}Relax, it’s all part of the plan.
ULRICH: Something wrong with the elevator?
JEREMIE: I’ll explain later. Hurry on up to help Yumi.
ODD: Get on.
SFX: (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)
(CELESTIAL HUMMING)
ULRICH: Yumi!
SFX: (HUMMING CONTINUES)
AELITA: Tower deactivated.
JEREMIE: Wow! Great job, Aelita!
Huh? Everything okay, Sissi?
SISSI: How do you expect everything to be okay,\Nwhen I’m surrounded by big, fat losers?
JEREMIE: Did I miss something?
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
JEREMIE: Come on, tell me.
ULRICH: Yes. Odd just offered Sissi a role in his next film.
ODD: It’s the story of this girl, driven by this mysterious being,\Nwho tried to make contact with humans.
All of which takes place in a virtual universe full of danger!
JEREMIE: What did she say?
AELITA: That no one would ever believe such a ridiculous story.
JEREMIE: (LAUGHING)\NYou don’t say?
YUMI: What about you, how’s it going?
JEREMIE: Finished! The computer deciphered all of--\N--the lines of code that Sissi spoke while she was spellbound.
ODD: So, what’s it say? Let’s hear it!
JEREMIE: Tons of interesting stuff, and a whole lot of elements--\N--that are going to help me find the antivirus for Aelita.
ULRICH: And... do you know who this mysterious entity who wants--\N--to get into contact with us is?
JEREMIE: Well… take a look.
I’m warning you, this is completely crazy.
DEFAULT: (GIBBERISH)
...I can help you. I want to enter into contact with you now…
ODD: Wow, I can’t believe it!
DEFAULT: I am Franz Hopper.
