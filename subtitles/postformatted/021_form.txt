JIM: Huh?
JIM: Oh, yeah!

DEFAULT: Hmmn.
ULRICH: Huh?

JIM: Ok guys, good warmup session.
JIM: Play like that and you’ll whip Lincoln Jr. High\Nwith no problem this afternoon’s final
JIM: I’ll see you all at the stadium after lunch for a final briefing
and always remember: a soccer team is like an army,\Nit needs a good general who can lead it
Right?\NSFX: (MURMURING AGREEMENT)
JIM: Now, break ranks.
JIM: (LAUGHTER)
JIM: Hey Ulrich\NWorking out to stay in shape?
JIM: Hey listen, kid, I’m gonna be honest with ya,\Nyou’re my key to winning this afternoon’s game.
JIM: I know we’ve got a good team\Nbut Lincoln’s got this striker, his name is Matt.
ULRICH: He’s nasty, I know\Nbut down’t worry, Jim, I won’t disappoint you.
JIM: I’m counting on you, kid.\NWe’re gonna {\i1}pulverize em{\i0}
JIM: Massacre em, we’re gonna make mincemeat outta them.\NWe’re gonna gobble em up and spit em out, maybe.
ODD: Hey there, champion, if Lincoln never gets the ball,\Nwe’re gonna be bored out there.
ULRICH: It’s nice of you to come.
ODD: We were here this morning and we’ll be here this afternoon
ODD: Not for you, of course, we can’t wait to see Sissi\Ncheerleading with her baton and all.
ODD: That’s why we’re coming.
SISSI: One, two, three, four,\NCome on team, give us heart.
SISSI: Five, six, seven, eight,\NLincoln we’re gonna seal your fate!
SISSI: Wooohooo\NTada!
SISSI: Huh?\NOh?
SFX: (ELECTRIC LIGHT PULSING)
SFX: (ELECTRIC LIGHT PULSING)
YUMI: Huh?
YUMI: Hm?
SFX: (ELECTRIC LIGHT PULSING)
SISSI: Yes, it disappeared, I tell you,\Nit never came down.
SISSI: It just-just flew away.
DEFAULT: Yeah sure, it’s up in the sky somewhere, right?\NOr maybe it came down and landed on someone’s head.
SISSI: Oh, but it’s true, I tell you, I swear,\Nmy baton just disappeared into thin air!
SISSI: DEFAULT: We believe you Sissi.\NHERB: Even if scientifically it’s impossible.
SISSI: Listen, if I said that a supernatural thing happened to me,\Nit’s because it’s true!
SISSI: You hear me, knucklehead?
SISSI: A baton that flies up has to come down\Nand if it doesn’t, there’s something wrong.
SISSI: Something seriously wrong\Nand I wanna know exactly what it is.
ULRICH: Huh?
DEFAULT: Look, it’s the mysterious baton twirler.
DEFAULT: Hey Sissi, eat your steak and french fries fast,\Nbefore they fly away.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
JEREMIE: Uh oh.
DEFAULT: (x2) We’ve gotta talk right now!
AELITA: Yes Jeremie, I’ve just spotted an\Nactivated tower in the mountain region.
AELITA: Why? Have you noticed anything strange\Ngoing on in your world?
ODD: Oh, just the usual things, batons that into the air and don’t come back and Yumi just suddenly airborne.
YUMI: It was so weird.
YUMI: The lights all started to blink and a second later,\NI was floating in the air, I couldn’t believe it.
JEREMIE: A break in the field of gravity causing spontaneous and localized weightlessness.
ULRICH: what’s the connection between electricity and weightlessness?
JEREMIE: The magnetic field, it could be the\Neffect of a very powerful electromagnet--
JEREMIE: that Xana’s using to offset the magnetic--\N--attraction of the earth. You see?
YUMI: How dangerous is it?
JEREMIE: It’s not. If it’s within the limits of space and time
JEREMIE: But if it’s on a larger scale, look what happened to Sissi,\Nher baton never came back.
YUMI: We can’t afford to take the risk,\Nwe have to go to Lyoko and deactivate the tower.
ULRICH: Well count me out.
YUMI: Hm?
JEREMIE: Huh? You;ve gotta be kidding.
ULRICH: No, I said count me out. I’ll go when the game’s over.
JEREMIE: You’re going to abandon the ship for a soccer game?
JEREMIE: I don’t believe it. Wake up, Ulrich, this is about saving the world--
JEREMIE: --not to mention Aelita who’s surely in danger\Nbut you would rather kick a-a ball around?
ULRICH: You heard what I said,\NI can’t go and that’s that. Okay?
JEREMIE: Somebody else say something, will you?\NHe’s dropping us like a smelly sock.
ULRICH: Look, I’m really sorry.
JEREMIE: That’s all you can say? You’re sorry?\NYou’d rather please the crowd, huh?
JEREMIE: All those admiring fans are more important than your friends.
ODD: Leave him alone, he’s got his reasons.
ODD: His parents are coming to the game this afternoon.
ODD: Have you ever met Ulrich’s dad?
ODD: If you’re not first in everything,\Nthen you’re nothing in his book.
ODD: And since Ulrich’s report cards are kinda disastrous,\Nthe only way to make his dad happy is--
JEREMIE: --When he plays soccer.
ODD: Yeah exactly.\NThat’s why he’s been training so hard for weeks now.
ODD: He’s gonna play today’s game as if his life depended on it.
AELITA: Hm.
JEREMIE: Why couldn’t he have just told us the reason?
YUMI: Ulrich? Give away a secret?
ODD: Anyway, why worry?
ODD: Ulrich’s going to win the game and in the meantime,\Nwe’re going to save the world.
ODD: We’ll just have to do without him this time\Nand besides, you’ve got me, don’t you?
JIM: Alright guys, the big day is here.
ULRICH: Huh?
ODD: Yeah!
MILLY: Testing one, two, testing, one, two.\NHere we go.
MILLY: Hello everyone, this is Milly and Tamiya,\Nreporting to you live from the stadium.
MILLY: It’s a big day today, the ninth grade\Ninter-school final is about to begin.
MILLY: Although our school is favored to win,\Na lot is going to depend on kadic striker, our own Ulrich.
MILLY: We’re really counting on him today\Nand now, everybody, it’s soccer time!
SFX: (CHAIR WHIRRING)\N(VARIOUS MACHINES BEEPING)
SFX: (WHISTLE BLOWING)
ULRICH: Come on
JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita, do you read me?\NAelita.
AELITA: {\i1}I’m here Jeremie
JEREMIE: Aelita, it’s Xana, he’s attacking,\Nhe’s trying to take over the city’s electrical network.
AELITA: {\i1}But why?
JEREMIE: I don’t know but I’m gonna try to find out.
JEREMIE: I’ll get the spy program started.
JEREMIE: With the dataflow so dense,\Nthere ought to be traces of it on the network.
JEREMIE: Bingo! That’s Xana alright.\NHeavy and predictable.
SFX: (CHEERING)
MILLY: Incredible,\Nwe knew that Ulrich was in great form
MILLY: but what’ he’s showing us today--\N--is beyond even our wildest dreams.
MILLY: MATT: Hey!\NULRICH: Yaaah!
MILLY: A fantastic goal and the Kadic team makes it one to nothing\Nafter only three minutes of play.
MILLY: Lincoln’s going to find a way to stop Ulrich\Nif they’re going to win this game.
JEREMIE: Heavy but very fast.\NWe don’t have much time. Ready to go?
ODD: No problemo.
JEREMIE: We’ve gotta hurry up because if we don’t,\NXana will be able to create much more powerful magnetic fields.
JEREMIE: Transfer, Yumi.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Transfer, Odd.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Scanner, Yumi.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Scanner, Odd.
JEREMIE: Virtualization!
JEREMIE: {\i1}The tower is situated at 30 degrees west.\NHurry up, huh?
AELITA: {\i1}I see it, Jeremie.{\i0}\NOver here!
DEFAULT: Kadic! Kadic! Kadic!
MILLY: There’s no stopping Ulrich!\NHe’s amazing to watch!
MILLY: It’s two-nothing and the score may\Nget out of hand if Ulrich keeps this up.
TAMIYA: He looks so handsome  when he runs.
MILLY: Well thanks, Tamiya,\Nfor that expert commentary on the game!
JEREMIE: Oh no! He’s ready to attack the school.
JEREMIE: Now I understand.
ODD: Fill us in, Einstein.
JEREMIE: {\i1}If not{\i0} for what happened today,\Nwith Yumi and Sissi, we’d have all gone to the game
JEREMIE: and that’s where Xana wanted to\Ntrap us because it was his plan.
JEREMIE: To concentrate all of the energy on the science lab\Nand if we don’t make it fast there’s
JEREMIE: {\i1}a good chance Ulrich’s gonna finish the game\Noutside of the stratosphere!
YUMI: No monsters for the time being\Nbut we’re still far from the tower.
JEREMIE: Oh, this is awful.\NI gotta find a way to gain some time.
SFX: (ELECTRIC LIGHT PULSING)
JEREMIE: You asked for it Xana, I can hack a network,\Nyou’re not the only one.
JIM: Go on, now! Stop Matt!\NHe’s getting away!
MILLY: Fantastic, Ulrich’s as good on defense\Nas he is on the attack.
JIM: Go, Ulrich, go, go!
JEREMIE: This program will help me counter--\N--any of Xana’s attacks on the science lab.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, do you copy?
MILLY: That’s the end of the first half.\NKadic has a commanding two-nothing lead.
MILLY: Let’s see if we can get some comments first-hand.
MILLY: Ulrich? I imagine you’re confident after--\N--dominating Lincoln for the past 45 minutes.
MILLY: What do you think?
ULRICH: Uh, Lincoln’s in the finals,\Nthat means they’re a good team.
ULRICH: In the words of our coach, Jim,\NIt’s our motivation that’ll make us winners.
ULRICH: And I honestly that--
ULRICH: --Ah, I’ve gotta go not, talk to you after the game.\NI better relax a bit before the second half.
And see what Jim has to-- Uh--\NSFX: (PHONE RINGING)
JEREMIE: Answer your phone, Ulrich, please!
ULRICH: {\i1}What do you want?
JEREMIE: Ulrich, I’ve been trying to reach--\N--you for a quarter of an hour.
ULRICH: I can’t play with a cellphone in my hand.\NSorry.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Listen, I know about- well,\NOdd told me why this match is so important to you
JEREMIE: but there’s an enormous and serious problem.
JEREMIE: I can’t go into all the details, there’s not enough time\Nbut Xana’s gonna put the school into orbit.
ULRICH: What was that?
JEREMIE: It’s true, I swear, he doesn’t have enough power yet--
JEREMIE: ULRICH: --But--\NJEREMIE: --But he’s gonna try and get it from the science lab’s generator.
JEREMIE: You’ve gotta make sure that nobody is in the building.
JIM: Hey, Ulrich!\NSecond half’s starting.
ULRICH: Be right there!\NNo problem. Everyone’s at the game.
JEREMIE: Are you absolutely sure?
SFX: (CHEERING)
ULRICH: Oh, Mrs. Hertz isn’t here.

MILLY: Oh! What’s wrong? What’s wrong?
JEREMIE: {\i1}Look, I’m sorry, Ulrich,\Nyou;ve got to leave the game.
JEREMIE: {\i1}You’re the only one who can do it.\NYou’ve gotta save her.
MILLY: Oh, everyone is just numb, the crowd,\Nincluding yours truly, simply doesn’t understand.
Why has Ulrich just stopped?\NTAMIYA: It must be the pressure.
DEFAULT: (CONFUSED MURMURING)
JIM: Oh!
JIM: MRS. STERN: Oh.\NMR. STERN: Hmmn.
JEREMIE: It’s a matter of life and death, Ulrich.
MILLY: Oh, it’s unbelievable,\Nthe Lincoln team have just cut our lead in half.
MILLY: Matt, himself, can hardly believe\Nthat Ulrich let him score.
MILLY: JEREMIE: {\i1}Ulrich! What are--\NULRICH: --Please, shut up, Jeremie, just shut up.
I’m gonna stop you!\NMATT: We’ll see about that!
ULRICH: Ahhgh!
MILLY: Oh no, it can’t be!\NWhat awful luck for the kadic team.
MILLY: Ulrich looks hurt after that violent tackle by Matt!
MATT: Oh come on,\NI didn't even touch him.
SISSI: Yes, it’s true!
ULRICH: (AGONIZING GRUNTING)
JIM: Ulrich! Oh no! I don’t believe it.\NYou- you can’t do this!
ULRICH: Leave me alone, Jim.
MILLY: Oh, wow, absolutely incredible!\NOur superstar striker is leaving the field with a knee injury.
TAMIYA: Our one irreplaceable player is out of the game!
SISSI: I don’t believe it for a minute\Nand I’m gonna check this out.
SISSI: I’m leaving as well.\NTell me everything that happened while I’m gone.
NICHOLAS: Sissi, you’re our cheerleader!
SISSI: There’s not gonna be a lot of cheering without Ulrich\Nand if we do score a goal you can replace me.
SISSI: The crowd will love it.\NJust dance your head off.
ODD: Jeremie, objective in sight,\Nthe welcoming committee looks manageable.
ODD: I’ll take care of them in no time at all.
JEREMIE: Ok, I should be able to neutralize--\N--Xana but only for a few minutes.
JEREMIE: So you’ve gotta work fast.
ODD: We’ve gotta move.
YUMI: Ten seconds to attack time.
ODD: Ok, Yumi, go!
SFX: (LASER SHOTS)
DEFAULT: Ahh!
ODD: Pretty sharp mosquitos,\Nsince when do they grow brains?
YUMI: But there’s only one left.
JEREMIE: Negative, a new swarm of hornets is on the way.
YUMI: Ok, change of tactics, this time we’ll try diversion.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Odd, I’ve reloaded 20 arrows for you\Nbut that may not be enough!
ODD: Laser arrow!\NAhh!
ODD: Your turn, Yumi.
ODD: Laser arrow!
ODD: {\i1}They just keep coming,\Nthere’s no end to them.
ULRICH: {\i1}Jeremie?\NI just left the stadium.
JEREMIE: Oh, thanks Ulrich.\NWhat you’re doing is--
ULRICH: Yeah I know,\NI’m on my way to the chemistry lab.
ODD: What do we do now?
YUMI: The best defense is an offense, right?
ODD: Right but it depends on the number of enemies.
JEREMIE: {\i1}It’s ok, Ulrich, I made my own--\N--electric field to create a short circuit.
JEREMIE: But Xana’s bound to {\i1}get ahead of me again soon,\Nso be very careful.
JEREMIE: I don’t know how long it’s gonna last.
ULRICH: I just walked in,\Nthere’s nothing at all happening.
ULRICH: Uh?\NHuh?
