JEREMIE: Yumi’s only got 10 life points left!\NJEREMIE: Get ready, girls.
JEREMIE: I’m starting up the devirtualization process.\NULRICH: Activated towers, Lyoko battles, danger.
ULRICH: Aren’t you guys startin'\Nto get sick of all this?\NODD: No.
JEREMIE: No.\NULRICH: Well, sometimes I really wish\Nwe were done with XANA.
ODD: Uh, you missed an episode, Ulrich.\NODD: Remember, Aelita's\Ncarrying a miserable virus
ODD: that links her to her old friend XANA.\NODD: Bye-bye XANA means bye-bye Aelita.
JEREMIE: And I don’t know how to\Ncreate an anti-virus.\NJEREMIE: I mean, not just yet.
AELITA: Hey, I have an idea!\NAELITA: Why don't we explore the new\Nmysterious sector we discovered?
JEREMIE: Sector five?\NJEREMIE: But we don’t know what’s in it!
ODD: Sure we do!\NODD: There are monsters,\Nultra-dangerous traps,
ODD: and a scyphozoa, as you call it,\Nthat wants to steal Aelita’s memory.\NAELITA: You’re right, but what if\Nthere's something else there?
AELITA: Like information about XANA?\NAELITA: We have to go back.
ULRICH: Good idea.\NULRICH: All three of us will go.
AELITA: You mean all four of us.\NAELITA: I want to be part of this expedition.
JEREMIE: With that scyphozoa slinking around?\NJEREMIE: No way.
AELITA: What if there’s a tower to deactivate?\NAELITA: Think about it!
AELITA: I have to be there.\NODD: Come on, Einstein!
ODD: With bodyguards like us,\Nshe has nothing to worry about!\NODD: And I promise to be careful!
JEREMIE: Okay.\NJEREMIE: Tomorrow night, exploration.
YUMI: (GASPS)\NOh my gosh! It’s so late!\NYUMI: My parents must be\Ngoing bananas!
YUMI: Bye! See you tomorrow!\NODD: And as for us, we missed dinner again.
ODD: And when I think it was\Nspaghetti and meatballs!\NMR. ISHIYAMA: Yumi, we need to talk.
MR. ISHIYAMA: You come home late\Nevery single night.\NMR. ISHIYAMA: Tonight is the last straw.
MR. ISHIYAMA: It’s past 10 o’clock\NMR. ISHIYAMA: and you didn't even bother\Nto telephone us.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: And you haven’t eaten anything, either.\NMRS. ISHIYAMA: What’s going on, dear?
MRS. ISHIYAMA: If you have a problem,\Nyou know you can tell us.\NYUMI: No, really. Everything’s fine.
YUMI: I was studying math at Maïtena’s house.\NYUMI: I told you already.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Maïtena Lecuyer?\NYUMI: Uh-huh.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Hmm. That’s strange.\NMR. ISHIYAMA: When I called her, she was studying.
MR. ISHIYAMA: By herself.\NMRS. ISHIYAMA: You’re lying to us, Yumi.\NThat’s not like you.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: What’s the matter with you?\NMRS. ISHIYAMA: I worry about you, sweetheart.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Tell me what’s bothering you.\NYUMI: I promise you that\Neverything's just fine.
YUMI: You saw my last report card.\NYUMI: It was great, so why worry about me?
DEFAULT: (SIGHS)\NMRS. ISHIYAMA: I’m concerned, Takeo.
MR. ISHIYAMA: We’re going to have to\Nget a lot more strict.\NYUMI: It’s nice of you to come with me,
YUMI: but I’m big enough to go\Nto school alone. Really, I am.\NMR. ISHIYAMA: You are, huh?
MR. ISHIYAMA: If you were, then you’d stop lying to us\NMR. ISHIYAMA: and tell us why you come\Nhome so late all the time.
YUMI: Are you gonna watch me\N24 hours a day? Is that it?\N\NYUMI: Am I in prison or something?
MRS. ISHIYAMA: We’re trying to understand you\Nand to protect you, too.\NYUMI: Oh, wow!\NThe entire Ishiyama family!
YUMI: I bet that you’ll be\Npicking me up as well, huh?\NMR. ISHIYAMA: I'll be waiting for you\Nhere at 5 o'clock.
MR. ISHIYAMA: I advise you not to be late.\NSISSI: Oh, isn’t that adorable!
SISSI: (CACKLES)\NYUMI: They’re not gonna ease up on me.
YUMI: Oh, what a mess.\NYUMI: The worst thing is\NI hate lying to them.
ODD: Just explain to them that\Nwe’re fighting in a virtual universe\NODD: against a demonic\Nartificial intelligence.
ODD: That ought to reassure them.\NYUMI: Dork.
JEREMIE: You’ve got to win back\Ntheir trust in you.\NJEREMIE: I think maybe you should\Nstay away from Lyoko for a little while.
YUMI: Huh?\NYUMI: What about exploring sector five!
YUMI: It’s for tonight, isn’t it?\NULRICH: Don’t worry. Jeremie will\Ngive you a play-by-play update.
JEREMIE: Promise.\N: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
ODD: Come on, guys.\NODD: I know you’re all dying to go\Nto Mrs. Hertz's class. Off we go.
JEREMIE: Did you study for the\Nmarine biology test?\NODD: Of course I did! Listen.
ODD: Fish are remarkably\Nwell adapted to water.\NODD: What’s more, they can swim.
JEREMIE: You are so lame.\NDEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
JEREMIE: Off to the forest sector!\NJEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.\NJEREMIE: Transfer Aelita.
JEREMIE: Scanner Ulrich.\NJEREMIE: Scanner Aelita.
JEREMIE: Scanner Odd.\NJEREMIE: Virtualization!
JEREMIE: Everything okay?\NODD: We’re good.\NThe monsters must be sleeping.
ODD: They need all the sleep\Nthey can get to recover from\NODD: all the grief we’ve been giving them.
JEREMIE: You have to get to the\Nother end of the sector\NJEREMIE: to take the transporter.
JEREMIE: I’m going to materialize your rides.\NODD: Yahoo!
ODD: Yeah!\NULRICH: Odd, you promised to be careful!
ODD: No problem!\NJEREMIE: Go straight ahead and hurry up\Nbefore the monsters get there!
AELITA: We made it, Jeremie!\NJEREMIE: Okay. I’m entering the code.
: Scipio.\NODD: There’s the transporter.
ULRICH: Whoa.\NYUMI: Are you there, Jeremie?
JEREMIE: Yumi?\NYUMI: Everything okay?
JEREMIE: Yumi!\NYUMI: Everything okay?
JEREMIE: Yeah, they’re in the transporter.\NAll is well.\NYUMI: Tell them I’m thinking about them.
JEREMIE: Happy campers?\NULRICH: Yep. I’m beginning to get\Nused to these little trips.
ODD: Ugh, not me!\NODD: I shouldn’t have had\Nthat fifth dessert at lunch.
AELITA: Jeremie, the wall's about to open.\NJEREMIE: Right. Meaning the\Ncountdown's gonna start.
JEREMIE: You’ve got to find a\Nway to deactivate it.\NJEREMIE: That must be the answer\Nto exploring further.
JEREMIE: Watch it, guys!\NULRICH: Everything will be fine.
ULRICH: Odd promised to be careful.\NJEREMIE: It started!
JEREMIE: You know what'll happen if Aelita\Nloses her life points, don't you!\NULRICH: Don’t worry.
ULRICH: We have no intention of losing her.\NAELITA: The last time, there was a big room\Nat the end of this hallway.
JEREMIE: I've got a feeling the\Narchitecture of the core zone\NJEREMIE: changes each time you go there.
ODD: That’s a great help\Nfor finding our way around.\NULRICH: If we knew everything,\Nwe wouldn’t be exploring.
ULRICH: Come on. Let’s go!\NJEREMIE: Look out! You've got\Ntwo creepers on your tail!
ODD: Laser arrow!\NJEREMIE: You’ve only got three minutes\Nleft to stop the countdown! Get going!
ULRICH: That way.\NULRICH: Come on!
ULRICH: Haven’t we already\Nbeen through here?\NODD: How should I know?
ODD: Everything looks\Nthe same in this place!\NAELITA: This way!
JEREMIE: Wow, 40 life points in one go!\NJEREMIE: Those creepers sure are powerful!
ODD: They’re powerful!\NODD: And really ugly, too!
ULRICH: Jeremie, any ideas?\NJEREMIE: No, but I got news for you.
JEREMIE: You’re in a labyrinth.\NJEREMIE: Make a left at each fork,\Nand leave a mark there.
JEREMIE: If the way is already marked,\Nthen make a right.\NODD: This is incredible!
ODD: We’ll never get out of this thing!\NJEREMIE: You’d better!
JEREMIE: Just two minutes left to find\Na way to stop the countdown!\NAELITA: We’re out, Jeremie! We made it!
ODD: Nothing like having\Na little luck on your side.\NODD: Hey, Einstein, why\Ncomplicate things, huh?
ULRICH: Ah, great. Now what do we do?\NODD: Jeremie, can you see\Nanything from your end?
JEREMIE: So, you need me again, huh?\NJEREMIE: Go back to where you were.
JEREMIE: I spotted a mechanism on the wall.\NJEREMIE: Hurry! Time's running out!
AELITA: There!\NODD: Let me at it!
JEREMIE: Fourteen! Thirteen! Twelve!\NJEREMIE: Eleven! Ten! Nine!
JEREMIE: Eight! Seven! Six!\NJEREMIE: Five! Four!
ODD: Agh!\NULRICH: No!
ULRICH: Agh!\NAELITA: Ulrich!
JEREMIE: Aelita, the countdown is over.\NJEREMIE: The room is bound to change now.
JEREMIE: You okay?\NAELITA: Well, no more creepers. That’s a start.
JEREMIE: Don’t worry.\NJEREMIE: I’ll rematerialize Odd and Ulrich,\Nand I’ll get you out of there.
JEREMIE: Come on, come on!\NDEFAULT: (BEEPS)
JEREMIE: Oh, no!\NJEREMIE: Aelita, Odd and Ulrich\Ndidn’t come back!
AELITA: What?\NAELITA: But that’s impossible. Are they lost?
JEREMIE: For the moment, they are.\NAELITA: So there’s no rematerialization\Nfrom sector five?
JEREMIE: Sure there is.\NJEREMIE: Once we find the right program.
AELITA: And do you think you can find it?\NJEREMIE: It’s probably as easy as\Nfinding your antivirus.
JEREMIE: But don’t worry.\NI'm gonna do the impossible.\NYUMI: Hiroki, could you make\Nsome more noise, please?
HIROKI: Sorry, Yumi. The volume's\Nas high as it goes.\NMR. IHSIYAMA: Hiroki.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Go into the other room, Hiroki.\NGo on now.\NMR. ISHIYAMA: I pass.
YUMI: Me, too. I pass.\NMR. ISHIYAMA: Then the game is over!\N(LAUGHS)
MR. ISHIYAMA: I have five points more than you!\NYUMI: On the Goban, yes.
YUMI: Don’t forget that I played the whites.\NYUMI: With Komi, I win by half a point.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Oh.\NYUMI: (YAWNS)
YUMI: Well, it’s bed time.\NYUMI: Goodnight.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Goodnight, my dear.\NYUMI: Jeremie, how’s it going?
JEREMIE: Badly. Head for the factory.\NAELITA: Jeremie?
AELITA: Can you hear that?\NJEREMIE: It’s the scyphozoa!
JEREMIE: It’s heading towards you!\NJEREMIE: Stay calm. Yumi’s coming.
DEFAULT: (SCREECHING)\NMRS. ISHIYAMA: Yumi, can I come in?
MRS. ISHIYAMA: I want to talk to you for a minute.\NMRS. ISHIYAMA: Huh?
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Yumi?\NYUMI: Jeremie, I’m in the elevator.
JEREMIE: You have to get Aelita in sector five!\NJEREMIE: The Scyphozoa is there!
YUMI: What about Odd and Ulrich?\NJEREMIE: You want the best case scenario?
YUMI: I’d rather.\NJEREMIE: I’ve got about a one in a million\Nchance of finding the right code
JEREMIE: to bring them back.\NJIM: (YAWNS)
MR. ISHIYAMA: So sorry to bother you at such\Na late hour, Headmaster Delmas,\NMRS. ISHIYAMA: but we’re very worried.
MR. DELMAS: Yes, yes. I understand.\NBut it’s quite possible\NMR. DELMAS: that Yumi is somewhere on the campus.
JIM: Why, sure!\NJIM: She’s probably hanging out\Nwith her little gang of friends.
JIM: Come on.\NJEREMIE: You’re on the edge of the territory, Yumi.
JEREMIE: Better be careful.\NJEREMIE: XANA’s going to do all that he can\Nto keep you from taking the transporter.
YUMI: Jeremie! Enter…the code!\NJEREMIE: Yumi?
JIM: Huh. No one’s here.\NMR. DELMAS: No one’s in Stern’s room either.
SISSI: Looking for someone?\NMR. DELMAS: Uh, Sissi. Would you\Nknow where your friends
MR. DELMAS: Stern, Belpois, and\NDella Robbia might be?\NSISSI: Probably up to no good. As usual.
SISSI: But I don’t know where.\NSISSI: Although, their little mascot\Ncan find them for you.
MR. DELMAS: Mascot? What mascot?\NSISSI: Tada!
JIM: A flea-bitten mangy mutt!\NJIM: Huh. Well, excuse me, Mr. Delmas.
SISSI: Ew. Hey, little puppy.\NSISSI: Where’s your master, huh?
SISSI: Go get him!\NKIWI: (YAPS)
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Let’s follow him!\NJEREMIE: Hang in there, Aelita.
JEREMIE: Yumi’s on the way.\NAELITA: I hope so.
JEREMIE: Yumi? Can you hear me?\NYUMI: Yes. I’m in the arena.
YUMI: The transporter got to me just in time.\NYUMI: Horrible Kankrelat.
JEREMIE: Listen up, now.\NJEREMIE: You have to get to the corridor\Nand trigger the mechanism
JEREMIE: before the countdown runs out, okay?\NYUMI: Okay.
JEREMIE: If I’m right about how\Nthe core zone functions,\NJEREMIE: my plan should work.
JIM: Huh. What’s the matter with that hound?\NJIM: Oh, I don’t believe it!
JIM: This reminds me of when I\Nused to work in the sewers.\NMR. DELMAS: You, uh, used to work in the sewers, Jim?
JIM: I, uh…I’d rather not talk about it.\NJEREMIE: Only two minutes left, Yumi!
JEREMIE: Down to 10 points, Yumi!\NJEREMIE: This is not the time to mess up!
JIM: That’s weird.\NKIWI: (BARKS
JIM: (SQUEALS)\NMR. DELMAS: Jim, we’re wasting time!
JIM: Will you let go of that slipper! You flea-bitten--\NJIM: Come on! Let go of it!
JEREMIE: Yumi, this is no time to drag your feet.\NJEREMIE: I’ve located the mechanism.\NIt’s on your right.
JEREMIE: You have ten seconds!\NJEREMIE: Two seconds!
YUMI: It works, Jeremie!\NJEREMIE: The whole zone is being reconfigured!
JEREMIE: We did it!\NJEREMIE: Aelita, take the access behind you!
YUMI: Huh?\NYUMI: Wow!
YUMI: It’s some kind of elevator!\NJEREMIE: You know what we do\Nwith elevators, right?
YUMI: We ride 'em!\NAELITA: Yumi!
JEREMIE: Try to grab Aelita as you go by!\NAELITA: Where are you taking me?
YUMI: I have no idea.\NYUMI: There’s an interface!
AELITA: I can get in.\NAELITA: Incredible!
JEREMIE: What?\NAELITA: It’s unbelieveable.
AELITA: The interface gives access…\NAELITA: to XANA’s own data!
JEREMIE: Huh?\NAELITA: Sector five is where XANA lives!
YUMI: XANA’s not a very good housekeeper.\NYUMI: There’s some weird things\Nhanging around this place.
AELITA: I’ve got access to all kinds of data. It’s crazy!\NJEREMIE: Look for the specific\Ndevirtualization code for sector five.
JEREMIE: If you find it, we can\Nrescue Odd and Ulrich!\NYUMI: Jeremie, I’m gonna need the Overwing.
JEREMIE: Uh-oh. Bad news.\NJEREMIE: When Aelita’s working on the interface,\NI can’t do anything from my end.
AELITA: I think I found it. I’m transmitting it to you.\NJEREMIE: Okay. I’m taking over again now.
MR. DELMAS: What would a nice girl like Yumi doing here?\NJIM: Where are we, anyway?
YUMI: Jeremie, the Overwing! Now!\NJEREMIE: It’s on the way!
YUMI: How do we get out of here?\NAELITA: There are some tunnels.
YUMI: They’re closed!\NJEREMIE: Lets see.
JEREMIE: Tunnels…\N: What if…
JEREMIE: What if they corresponded to those\Nthat open onto the arena?\NJEREMIE: Yippie! It works!
YUMI: Nice one, Einstein!\NAELITA: Yumi!
AELITA: Jeremie, I got out through a way tower!\NJEREMIE: Okay. Now get to a neutral tower.\NI’ll bring you in!
JEREMIE: Okay. I’m ready, Aelita.\NJEREMIE: Code: Earth.
AELITA: It's okay, Jeremie. I’m here.\NAELITA: But what about the others?
JEREMIE: I’m entering the new code!\NJEREMIE: Materialization Yumi!
JEREMIE: Materialization Odd!\NJEREMIE: Materialization Ulrich!
JEREMIE: Now all we can do is hope.\NJEREMIE: Yeah!
AELITA: We did it!\NJEREMIE: Odd!
JEREMIE: How you feel? Say something!\NODD: Something!
ODD: Kiwi!\NMR. ISHIYAMA: Yumi? What are you doing here?
MR. DELMAS: I believe you all have\Nsome explaining to do.\NJIM: Hey!
JIM: Ah ha!\NJIM: Trying to outsmart me, huh?
JIM: What the…\NJIM: Belpois!
JIM: W-What?\NJIM: What is this place?
JEREMIE: Nothing rings a bell, Jim?\NJEREMIE: Funny 'cause you’ve\Nbeen here before.
JIM: What are you talking about?\NI don’t remember this!\NJEREMIE: Well, yes and no.
JIM: Huh?\NJEREMIE: Return to the past now.
MR. ISHIYAMA: So, then. You still refuse\Nto give us an explanation?\NYUMI: Alright, I’ll tell you.
YUMI: I’m in love.\NMR. ISHIYAMA: Ah, Yumi, I knew there was a reason.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: And would you tell us\Nyour boyfriend’s name?\NYUMI: No. Sorry, I won’t mom.
YUMI: See you tonight.\NSISSI: Ugh!
ULRICH: Well, that sure seemed to\Nsatisfy your parents.\NYUMI: What did you tell them?
YUMI: The truth.\NADVERT: CLOSED CAPTIONING PROVIDED BY\NREDDIT.COM/R/CODELYOKO
