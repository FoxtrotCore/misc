ULRICH: Can’t a guy sleep in peace around here?
ODD: Sorry, it’s Jean-Pierre.
ULRICH: What a ridiculous name for a Tamagotchi.\NJean-Pierre.
ODD: Don’t you pay attention to him my little coochie-coo.\NHe’s pretty cool, huh?
DEFAULT: (OMINOUS MUSIC)
NICHOLAS: (YAWNING)
ODD: He’s disappeared.
He’s disappeared!
ULRICH: Mind telling me who’s disappeared Odd?
ODD: Jean-Pierre’s disappeared.
ULRICH: Maybe he went out looking for someone who’ll give him a better name.
ODD: You stole my Jean-Pierre Ulrich,\Nand I want him back!
ULRICH: Hey are you out of your mind?\NI don’t want your dumb plastic Jean-Pierre.
ODD: But then if it wasn’t you then he had to have been kidnapped.
ULRICH: I sure hope your piggy-bank is full so you can pay the ransom.
ODD: Stop it, come on!\NDon’t you understand he’ll die of hunger if we don’t find him.
What are we gonna do, huh?
ULRICH: Hey, I know,\Nhow about some breakfast?
MR. DELMAS: Yes?
DEFAULT: Jean-Pierre Delmas?
MR. DELMAS: Yes?
DEFAULT: It seems Jean-Pierre,\Nyou’re interested in non-enriched uranium.
MR. DELMAS: What did you say?
ODD: Jean-Pierre’s not any old Tamagotchi virtual pet.\NHe’s only a few months old, he’s very fragile.
Would you abandon a helpless baby Jeremie?
JEREMIE: If he was just plastic I sure would.
ODD: We gotta go look for him right away.
ULRICH: I think it would be a lot better to wait.
ODD: I don’t get it. Wait for what?
ULRICH: For you to buy another one.
JEREMIE: (LAUGHTER)
ODD: Oh, I get the picture now.
I thought that good friends were there when you needed them,\Nbut I guess I was mistaken.
SISSI: What do you know? You left your little Tama-sushi at home?
ODD: Do you like soggy frozen waffles and cereal that’s genetically modified?
SISSI: Why do you wanna know that?
ODD: Cause I may stuff a few down your throat!
SISSI: Oh wow… He must have gotten up from the long side of the bed today.
HERB: Not a long side, it’s a wrong side.
SISSI: Zip up, right now, Herb!
MR. DELMAS: Now wait a minute, what is it you want?\NI haven’t done anything.
DEFAULT: You got an affinity for bombers,\Nespecially the long range kind.
And a particular affection for anthrax,\N and other degenerate stuff like that.
MR. DELMAS: But I assure you I’m a respectable school principal.
DEFAULT: Alright. We believe you.
MR. DELMAS: What’s the meaning of this?\NAnd who are you?
DEFAULT: We belong to an ultra high security division of the secret service.\NThe president himself has no idea that we exist.
Even we have no idea who we really are.
MR. DELMAS: But then you must--\NDEFAULT: Keep still.
At 10 PM last night the computer of a large weapons manufacturer was hacked.
And documents dealing with highly sensitive,\Nand classified defense data was accessed.
It so happens that the hacker unwittingly left a trail leading directly back to him.
And the trail lead us straight back to this phone line here in your school.\NWhose phone is it?
MR. DELMAS: This room is occupied by Jeremie Belpois.
DEFAULT: There’s something I just don’t get.
It’s impossible to hack into the system with that.\NHe’d need a much more powerful mainframe configuration.
Something that’s not available over the counter.
The question is, how did he get his hands on it?\NWho are his contacts? Which terrorist cell is he working for?
Right, we’ll keep this Jeremie Belpois under tight surveillance.
Microphones, cameras, we’re gonna watch him.\NHe doesn’t know it, but we’re gonna use him to break this group.
MR. DELMAS: But our Jeremie Belpois a terrorist?\NI can’t believe that.
In any event, let me assure you, gentlemen,\Nof my personal and total cooperation.
JIM: You know, I might be able to help.\NI never told you this sir, but I was a secret service agent for a couple of years there.
MR. DELMAS: You were?
JIM: Yes, that’s absolutely right, but I’d rather not talk about it.
DEFAULT: Enough.
Now listen, if you really wanna help, then set up the equipment with us.\NThat way, we might take you off the suspect list.
JEREMIE: So, when do you recall seeing Jean-Pierre for the last time?
ODD: For the hundredth time, he went to sleep right next to the bed.
JEREMIE: Okay then, Kiwi would’ve started to growl\Nif anyone would’ve come into the room.
AELITA: Yes, but not if he recognized who it was.
YUMI: Hi, what’s up guys?
AELITA: Jean-Pierre’s disappeared.
YUMI: You mean the principal?
DEFAULT: No the Tamagotchi.
YUMI: Oh.
JEREMIE: Odd, let’s go and see if we can find any clues in your room.
DEFAULT: {\i1}Password?
JIM: Birdbrain.
DEFAULT: That’s it, come on in.
JIM: Jim Morales reporting. Audio, video, \Nall mics and cameras discreetly hidden.
DEFAULT: Very good. Let’s get this show on the road.
It’s a good thing you weren’t a cameraman for a TV station.
JIM: But I did work as a TV cameraman.
MR. DELMAS: There! Camera 3A.
JIM: What are they doing at Della Robbia’s room at this time of day?
Why aren’t they in the lunchroom?
DELMAS: What? Jim would you mind telling me what a dog is doing in my establishment?
JIM: Uh… I… I don’t know sir, \Nit’s the first time I’ve ever seen it.
DEFAULT: Quiet you two.
KIWI: {\i1}(BARKING)
DEFAULT: Where did you put the microphone?
JIM: Under the bed.
DEFAULT: Well done, right next to a noisy dog.
DELMAS: They’re… They’re all leaving the room now.
DEFAULT: Camera 2C, dormitory hallway.
JIM: I thought it was real clever idea to conceal the camera behind that distinguisher, insignia.\NI mean inquisitioner.
ODD: {\i1}I’m getting more and more worried. This is serious.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Yeah we know, if we don’t find Jean-Pierre in the next eight hours, it’s the end of the world.
MR. DELMAS: Did you hear that?\NHe just said Jean-Pierre, why that’s my name as well.
DEFAULT: Oh yes, we heard it.\NIs there anything you’d care to tell us, Jean-Pierre?
MR. DELMAS: But this is completely absurd! I’ve nothing to do with this I tell you.
DEFAULT: Okay drop it.\NTime to turn things up a notch.
Jim, I want you to put a tracer on the suspect.\NThat way, they’ll never be out of our reach.
AELITA: Still nothing?
JIM: What are you doing in here? Out!\NOn the double.
JEREMIE: Hey! Is anything to matter Jim?
JIM: Ah those darn mosquitos.
ODD: Just think I’m going to lunch at the same time Jean-Pierre--\N--is dying a slow and painful death because he has nothing to eat.
ULRICH: Life is so tough.
And since he’s just a piece of plastic with no feelings\Nhe’s blaming you for his misery.
JEREMIE: Hang on.
Xana’s on the attack!
ODD: Oh that’s great, I’m never gonna find Jean-Pierre.
Doesn’t Xana ever take a little lunch break?
JEREMIE: No.\NAnd so we’re not gonna take any either.
Let’s go, come on!
JIM: Chickenhawk calling the henhouse.\NThe bird has flown the coop.
I repeat, the bird has flown the coop.
DEFAULT: {\i1}What kind of gibberish is that?\NWould you mind speaking normally?
JIM: {\i1}Uh, Belpois and his pals are on the move.
DEFAULT: Okay. Stay on their tails.
JIM: Oh wow, they’re going into the sewers.\NHey, do you read me?
DEFAULT: Loud and clear.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
{\i1}Here are your vehicles.
{\i1}The activated tower is situated South, South-West.
ODD: Last one there is a rotten egg!
DEFAULT: That way.
AELITA: That’s crazy. The tower, is not activated.
ODD: Got an explanation Einstein?
JEREMIE: Seems like Xana’s found a way to mess up the superscan.
YUMI: But why would he lure us to Lyoko?
JEREMIE: {\i1}No idea. But I don’t like it.\NI’m bringing you back in right now.
DEFAULT: Step away from that keyboard.
JEREMIE: Huh? What?
DEFAULT: You’re under arrest.
JEREMIE: But what have I done?
DEFAULT: That’s for you to tell us kid.\NWhat happened to your pals, where are they?
And Jean-Pierre?
Right, take him in. I’ll stay here with Morales and see what evidence we can find.
Don’t just stand there, find me those other kids. Fast!
AELITA: Jeremie what are you waiting for?
ULRICH: What’s wrong with you Odd?
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
YUMI: Something’s very wrong, Jeremie?
ULRICH: Fire at me Odd.
ODD: Well, you did make fun of my Tamagotchi\Nbut that’s not much of a reason to zap you Ulrich.
ULRICH: This is no time for jokes.
ODD: Okay, anything for good cause.
ULRICH: Oh no!
JIM: Hey Stern, I want you to explain to me\Nwhat all of this UFO equipment is doing here.
ULRICH: Sorry about this Jim, but I have no choice.
JEREMIE: I swear to you,\NI’ve never hacked any information in my life.
SFX: (PHONE RINGING)
ULRICH: Jeremie? Where are you there’s a weirdo in the lab.
JEREMIE: Ulrich! This is all Xana’s doing you hear me?\N{\i1}Bring everyone back home!
DEFAULT: Very interesting. Who is this Xana?\NA guy who recruited Jean-Pierre?
JEREMIE: Please listen. Just trust me this one time\Nand let me go back to the factory.
I’ve gotta help my friends.
No.
DEFAULT: What is this? A video game?
(GROWLING)
MR. DELMAS: Are you alright?
No!
DEFAULT: (GROWLING)
JIM: Morales reporting, I finally apprehended the Stern boy\Ndown in the underground room.
But then he managed to escape.
You wanna see for yourself?
ODD: Seems to be real this time.
JIM: Hey, I don’t wanna pry but uh,\NI’d like to know what you’re doing.
I want an answer you hear?
Now you listen to me, let go my arm.\NYou don’t, I promise you, sparks are gonna fly.
ULRICH: {\i1}Yumi, Aelita, Odd, do you read me?
AELITA: Ulrich, what’s the matter?\NWhere’s Jeremie?
ULRICH: No idea, all I know is that there’s this weirdo in the lab\N{\i1}who’s possessed by Xana.{\i0}
There is got to be an activated tower somewhere.
YUMI: {\i1}In which sector?
ULRICH: How should I know?\NDid you forget how awful at computers I am?
AELITA: Listen to me Ulrich, I’m going to guide you.
ULRICH: The tower is in the Mountain Sector.
25 degrees West, and 72 degrees South.\NBetter hurry up cause-- Wait a second.
ODD: Uh, Ulrich did you just hit delete or something?
ULRICH: No but something very un-cool is going on down below.
AELITA: {\i1}Ulrich, hit the enter key.
ULRICH: Bad news.
The guy possessed by Xana is trying to destroy the supercomputer.\NAnd the scanners are offline.
AELITA: Xana’s plan is to diabolical.\NIf the supercomputer’s destroyed Lyoko will disappear forever and all of us along with it.
YUMI: You have to get the scanners back online and bring us in fast!
ULRICH: Sounds good, but I’m no Jeremie.\NI can’t put anything online.
The best we can do is you to deactivate that tower,\Nwhile I deal with that creepo downstairs.
ODD: Roger, be careful. Time for us to change sectors.
AELITA: We better watch our life points.\NIf we lose them all with the scanners offline, it’ll be game over for good.
DEFAULT: (SHOUTING)
YUMI: Aelita!
ODD: That’s what I call extreme.
DEFAULT: (SHOUTING)
ODD: That disappearing act isn’t very cool.
AELITA: Yumi!\NDEFAULT: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
ODD: Hey, ever heard of fair play?
Okay okay okay, I take it back!
DEFAULT: (GROWLING)
AELITA: Watch out.
JIM: A-ha! Now who’s the boss, huh?
YUMI: Odd!
ODD: Thanks Yumi.
YUMI: The tower, hurry!
DEFAULT: (SHOUTING)
(GROWLING)
ULRICH: Oh no, seven years bad luck.
ODD: Yeah!
DEFAULT: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
AELITA: Let’s hope it works.
JIM: Honestly I haven’t got the slightest idea what this junk is used for.\NWhat did you say it was for?
ULRICH: We didn’t say anything at all.
JEREMIE: Well the supercomputer has taken a hit, it’s pretty badly damaged.\NI hope it’ll work again.
JIM: Hope what’ll work again?
JEREMIE: Return to the past now.
Return to the past now!
ODD: Oh no, not again…
ULRICH: Lost Jean-Pierre again, Odd?
ODD: Yeah, but this time I’m gonna find out who stole it.\NULRICH: Huh?
Listen up everybody! Now we’re gonna see who Jean-Pierre’s kidnapper was.
It was- It was you Ulrich?
You’re all bunch of traitors,\Nthe only one I can really trust is Yumi from now on.
YUMI: Um, Odd. It was my idea.
ODD: No. You too?\NBut what do you all have against my Jean-Pierre?
ULRICH: We did it for your own good.\NAnd ours, because you were starting to get hooked on him.
YUMI: Relax Odd Jean-Pierre’s just fine.\NBelieve me, he couldn’t be in better hands.
