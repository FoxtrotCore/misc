YUMI: Okay Jeremie, I’m on my way.
WILLIAM: Hey! Whoa-
YUMI: Hey!
WILLIAM: Yumi? What are you doing up so late?
YUMI: I wouldn’t exactly call this being up, would you…
WILLIAM: Sorry but I was speeding to get back to the dorm.\NI climbed the wall to go and see Skybreaker 4, but it was really lame.
YUMI: The first three were duds, why the big surprise?
WILLIAM: Guess I’m just too much of an optimist.\NEven when things start badly, I always feel they can get better if you give it time.
YUMI: Yeah, okay right. Well, now I’ve gotta go.
WILLIAM: Really? Where to?
YUMI: To save the world. Is that good enough answer for you?
Let me go William!
WILLIAM: Okay, but before I do you gotta give me a kiss good night.
YUMI: Alright, but first close your eyes.
WILLIAM: Great! Well I guess my evening was no waste after all.
Yumi?
Yumi?
YUMI?
YUMI: Here I am Jeremie, you can send me in.
JEREMIE: You got here just in time to welcome\NAelita, Odd and Ulrich on their return from Lyoko.
YUMI: You’ve already deactivated the tower?
ULRICH: Hey, what happened to you?
AELITA: Didn’t you hear your cell phone ring?
ODD: Nothing to worry about, I oversleep at least 3 times a week.
Of course with Ulrich who snores like a grizzly it’s a question of survival.
YUMI: Actually, it’s not only my sleep that’s beginning to bring me down.
JIM: Mathias Burrell?
DEFAULT: Present.
JIM: Immanuel Mayer?
DEFAULT: Present.
JIM: Maitena Lecuyer?
DEFAULT: Here.
WILLIAM: Hey you know, last night you pulled a fast one on me.
No-one has ever humiliated me like that before,\Nwhat did you do it for?
YUMI: Because I find your dumb two-bit casanova act sickening.
WILLIAM: But I…
YUMI: In the beginning it was pretty nice, but now I’m really fed up.\NSo why don’t you buzz off William and leave me alone?
JIM: William Dunbar?\NWilliam Dunbar!
WILLIAM: Okay, okay I’m not deaf!\NYou can see I’m here, can’t ya?
JIM: Dunbar, to the library! Out of my sight!\NNo swimming for you today, you got that?
WILLIAM: Anyway, I’d like to know what you had to do that was so important last night.
And I’m gonna find out what your big secret is. You bet on that.
AELITA: Don’t worry Jeremie, we’re gonna make a fabulous report.
JEREMIE: Well we better, it counts for the whole semester.
ULRICH: So, what’s latest in the world of Kadic Junior High today?
ODD: Is Judith Nivers going out with Ronald Limozin?
ULRICH: Who are Judith Nivers and Ronald Limozin?
ODD: How should I know? Anyway, it seems they are going out.
JEREMIE: Oh no, I don’t believe it. A Xana alert.
ULRICH: Not again.
JEREMIE: Yeah. And the big problem is that Aelita and me can’t\Nget out of history class. Not this time.
ODD: Hey, don’t sweat it Einstein. Ulrich and I will go and get ready.\NWhen you get there, you can send us to Lyoko.
But finish your report as fast as possible.
WILLIAM: Second rate casanova, huh?
ULRICH: I can’t reach Yumi, she’s not picking up.
ODD: What’s going on with her lately?\NLast night, and then now.
JEREMIE: Sir is it okay if we begin now?
DEFAULT: Yes you may, but where are Odd and Ulrich?
JEREMIE: Well, you see sir, they had something important to do, and…
DEFAULT: More important than my class?
JEREMIE: Well, actually, I wasn’t supposed to tell you,\Nbut they’re preparing a surprise for your class Mr. Fumet.
DEFAULT: A surprise? What kind of surprise?
JEREMIE: It’s a…\NIt’s a big historical show in your honor.
DEFAULT: Oh. I would never have guessed.\NI’ll excuse their absence this time.
AELITA: And now sir, can we begin?
DEFAULT: Yes yes of course, go on. Tell us everything you know about World War I.
JEREMIE: On June 28th 1914, a Serbian student assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand nephew of air to the Austrian-Hungarian emperor, Franz Joseph.
This took place in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\NPolitical alliances were reinforced and within’ a few days all of Europe became involved.
Serbia, Russia, France, Great Britain were on one side,\Nand Germany and Austria-Hungary the other.
Other countries became part of the conflict. Germany invaded Belgium.
Italy, Greece, Romania and the US joined the allies\Nwith Turkey and Bulgaria supporting central Europe.
The armistice signed in late October and early November of 1918 put an end to the fighting
but peace treaties had to be drawn up for a definitive end to the war\Nthat most people hoped would be the war to end all wars, clearing the way for a lasting peace.
Finally in Paris the victorious countries united in a peace conference--\N--with the two-fold vision of creating a league of nations,
and the adoption of peace treaties submitted to the defeated nations.
I hope that wasn’t too long.
Sir, may I go to the infirmary?\NI’ve got bit of a headache.
AELITA: Um, I do too sir.
DEFAULT: Yes, yes go on, go on.\NI’m not feeling too well either all of a sudden.
ODD: Ulrich, try Yumi’s mobile again.\NShe’s bound to answer sooner or later.
JIM: Today we’re going to have a little lesson in synchronized swimming.
That means no speed competitions no stopwatches just pure grace.
But since as someone once said a picture’s worth a thousand words,\Nhere’s a demonstration admire finesse.
YUMI: You know what I think?\NThat’s about as graceful as tractor pulling.
AELITA: You think we’ll get a good grade?\NWe said all we wanted to but it was a little fast.
JEREMIE: Fumet said a one page presentation, he didn’t give us any time limits.
AELITA: It seems that lately Xana’s getting more and more active. We’re constantly on Lyoko.
WILLIAM: Hey sorry to interrupt but,\Nyou mind telling me who this Xana dude is?
ODD: Ah, there you are. We’ve already started things up, your turn Einstein.
What’s William doing here?
JEREMIE: I guess he must have followed you guys.
WILLIAM: Wow, what is this thing huh?\NAnd What do you guys do in here?
ULRICH: Why don’t I clobber him?\NWILLIAM: Yea try it, if you think you’re good enough.
JEREMIE: Calm down.
Our priority now is the tower.\NAfterwards a simple return to the past and William won’t remember a thing.
WILLIAM: I wouldn’t bet on that, huh.\NI remember everything, and I’m great at holding a grudge.
AELITA: Where’s Yumi?
ULRICH: She’s unreachable.
WILLIAM: So that’s her secret. A supercomputer hideout.\NThat’s incredible.
Now I understand why she didn’t wanna tell me anything.
JEREMIE: We’re gonna have to make do without her. But I don’t like this at all.
WILLIAM: I can go and get her if you want.
ULRICH: I hope he’s not gonna rat on us to the Principal.
ODD: That’s not his style. And besides, this is an emergency Ulrich, we need Yumi.\NWe don’t know what kind of dirty trick Xana’s preparing.
JEREMIE: Transfer, Aelita.
Transfer, Odd.\NTransfer, Ulrich.
{/i1}Scanner, Aelita.\NScanner, Odd.
Scanner, Ulrich.
Virtualization.
Here come your vehicles.
The activated tower is in the Northern edge of the sector.\NFrom where you are, you should be able to see it’s halo.
ODD: Hey, how come you’re always right? Huh Einstein?
ULRICH: Okay Jeremie, we’re on it.
JIM: Be like me. Remember my example, my grace.
WILLIAM: Emergency Yumi, let’s go! Xana’s launched an attack!
JIM: Listen Dunbar, what is this gibberish?\NYou making fun of me or something?
WILLIAM: No, I mean… Not this time.
JIM: I… The principal’s office, on the double.
YUMI: You’re right Jim, because of him I nearly drowned.\NLet me take him to the principal’s office, just to make sure he doesn’t run away.
JIM: Good idea. Go on and take him Ms. Ishiyama.\NIt’s a very responsible attitude on your part.
You could learn a lot from her example Dunbar.
WILLIAM: Yes, you’re right. I know Yumi’s got a lot she can fill me in on.
JEREMIE: Watch it, there are Kankrelats just behind you.
AELITA: Okay, I’ll take care of them.
Energy field.
You know how many of them there are?
JEREMIE: A big gang of them.
AELITA: Thanks, nothing like precision.
ULRICH: Here we go!
Sorry guys, but I don’t play favorites.\NSame treatment for everyone!
Aelita, climb aboard.
ODD: Laser arrow!
ULRICH: Go on Aelita, hop off.
DEFAULT: (OMINOUS MUSIC)
JEREMIE: You’re closing in on it.
ODD: Great, tell that to the Kankrelats.\NThey’ll be overjoyed.
ULRICH: We’ll go separate ways and meet up on the other side.
ODD: Got’cha.
Hand on tight Aelita.\NReady for some turbulence?
Since when did Kankrelats had turbo-engines?
ULRICH: Are you two okay?
ODD: Sure, no problem.
WILLIAM: I still can’t figure out what you guys do in that old rundown factory.
YUMI: And I can’t figure why they agreed to let you lend us a hand.
WILLIAM: Maybe it’s just because they trust me, not like-
YUMI: Jeremie, it’s me. I’m…\NWe’re on the bridge.
JEREMIE: Odd and Ulrich are now pretty close to the activated tower.
YUMI: Oh no, I came too late for the party again.
WILLIAM: Hey who’s that guy?\NIs he one of your big superheroes?
YUMI: No, I fact I think he’s more of a big superbad-guy.
Jeremie, there’s someone here possessed by Xana,\Nso there’s a chance we might be a little late.
JEREMIE: Okay Yumi, be careful huh?\NI’ll tell the others that they’ve got to hurry up.
WILLIAM: Hey you mean that guy is our superenemy?\NElectric company worker? That’s so lame.
I was expecting something more gory.
Okay, I take it all back. He’s a super-enemy electrical worker.
ULRICH: You go on, I’ll take care of them.
That’s pretty sneaky to hit and run.
JEREMIE: Yumi, are you still there?
YUMI: Yes I am, but maybe not for long. This guy’s a terror.
JEREMIE: {/i1}Hang in there, Aelita should be in the tower any minute now.
WILLIAM: Let me have him Yumi.\NI’ll take care of him!
YUMI: William don’t!
JEREMIE: {/i1}Yumi? Yumi, what’s going on?{/i0} Yumi, c’mon answer please.\NOdd, you’ve gotta get the job done now.
ODD: No kidding we do, I thought we do it after tea-time.
WILLIAM: Look I’ve gotta tell you this okay, I…
YUMI: This is a very bad time William.
WILLIAM: I can’t swim!
AELITA: Tower deactivated.
JEREMIE: Bravo Aelita.
{/i1}Yumi?
YUMI: Jeremie? Nice going, you guys did it just in time.
JEREMIE: Everything okay on your side?
YUMI: {/i1}We’re good, but it was close call.
WILLIAM: Hey, what happened just now?
YUMI: Well Jeremie, now that it’s all over,\Nyou can launch a return in time right?
So that you know who doesn’t interfere with us again.
WILLIAM: What gives you the idea it’s all over?\NThis guy works for ”Explo-bat”.
YUMI: Yeah, so?
WILLIAM: If I’m not mistaken,\Nthis guy’s with a company that specializes in building demolition.
I bet he came here fully equipped,\Nto blow your factory sky high. Ba-boom!
YUMI: Did you hear what William just said?
JEREMIE: Yea, but relax Yumi. I’ll launch a Return to the past\Nand the explosives will disappear along with William’s memory.
Oh no, the Scyphozoa!
The Scyphozoa’s got Aelita!
YUMI: Why not launch a Return to the past anyway Jeremie?
JEREMIE: It’s too dangerous. We don’t know what might happen to Aelita\Nif {/i1}I do it while she’s in Xana’s clutches.{/i0}
So get back here now and I’ll send you to Lyoko.\NUlrich, Odd, you’ve gotta go find that bomb.
ULRICH: Will do.
Good luck Yumi.
YUMI: You too guys, find that dumb bomb\Nso our factory doesn’t go up in smoke.
WILLIAM: Think the three of us oughta split up.
ULRICH: Okay, let’s go.
JEREMIE: {/i1}Transfer, Yumi.
Scanner, Yumi.
Virtualization.
YUMI: It’s okay Jeremie, the Scyphozoa’s just released Aelita.
JEREMIE: {/i1}She’s probably gonna head for the--\N--waytower to start destroying the Ice sector.
And you’ve gotta stop her from doing that at all costs.
YUMI: Okay, consider it done.
Well, almost.
ODD: Okay, I’ve found it. It’s over here!
WILLIAM: No, that’s only one of the charges he set up.\NThere’s gotta be a detonator here somewhere. That’s what we’re looking for.
ULRICH: How do you know all this stuff?
WILLIAM: My uncle used to work in construction and I’d go with him during vacation.\NHe used show me how to…
ODD: Okay, family stories are all very moving but we’re kinda pressed here…
ULRICH: Thanks Odd. So, where do you think we’ll find the detonator?
WILLIAM: I don’t know, but the guy who works for ”Explo-Bat”, he oughta know.
ULRICH: Yeah sure, but he’s out cold like any normal ex-Xanafied guy.
ODD: You guys keep searching, I’ll try to wake him up.
JEREMIE: {/i1}Yumi you have to get through of that blockade of Megatanks.
Aelita is closing in on the waytower.
ODD: Hey come on sleeping beauty, wake up now!\NLook, it’s you prince charming.
DEFAULT: What’s going on? Where am I?\NMy dynamite!
Where are my explosives?
ODD: In the factory, with a detonator.\NCan you recall anything?
DEFAULT: No-- Oh, my head.
JEREMIE: Yumi!
Careful Yumi, you don’t have a lot of life points left.
ODD: Look carefully at this factory.
If you had to blow it up, where would you set up the detonator?
DEFAULT: I can’t think too straight, but…\NI guess I would put it somewhere high up so the signal could reach all charges.
ODD: {/i1}Ulrich, look for it somewhere over your head. Somewhere high up.
YUMI: It’s okay Jeremie, I’ve got Aelita in my sights.
ULRICH: I think I found the detonator.
WILLIAM: Where?
ULRICH: Way up there.
YUMI: I’m sorry Aelita, but I don’t have any choice.
ULRICH: {/i1}Jeremie, we found the detonator. We have to evacuate the factory now.\NEverything’s gonna blow in a few seconds.
JEREMIE: Impossible Ulrich, we {/i1}can’t leave Yumi and Aelita stranded on Lyoko.
WILLIAM: Gimme your belt.
I’m gonna try and defuse the detonator\Nand I need something to use as a sort of shunt.
ULRICH: You know how to do that?
WILLIAM: My uncle explained it to me… Uhh, once.
ULRICH: Once?
WILLIAM: Once is enough if you’re not too dumb that is.\NNow get outta here.
If it doesn’t work it’d be stupid for both of us to blow up.
ULRICH: Uh-uh, no way. If you stay, I stay.
ODD: That makes three of us.
JEREMIE: Yumi another hit like that and it’s game over for you.\NAnd then it’s gonna be the end of the Ice sector as well.
WILLIAM: Yeah!
ULRICH: Jeremie, William defused the detonator. We’re saved.
WILLIAM: Oh come on, please? I swear I won’t tell anyone.
ODD: He really does deserve to be one of us,\Nbesides we could use another soldier.
AELITA: And he’s already proven how much he can help.
JEREMIE: Well then, let’s vote.
If everybody votes yes,\Nthen William can officially become a member of our club.
Too bad William, there’s one no.
WILLIAM: You’re the big losers, I was kinda expecting this might happen.\NSome guys just can’t handle being jealous.
ULRICH: Well then, what do you suppose we should do now?
JEREMIE: What do you think? A Return to the past.
ODD: It was pretty un-cool Ulrich, why’d you vote no?
ULRICH: Hey don’t look at me, I’m not crazy about William,\Nbut he saved us and the factory.
He’s brave and he’d make a great Lyoko-Warrior.\NI didn’t blackball him.
ODD: If it wasn’t you and it wasn’t me,\Nand it wasn’t Jeremie or Aelita then it was…
YUMI: Sorry William, but I don’t think you can be trusted.
