JEREMIE: What can Yumi be doing?\NWe have to get some{\i1}data out of sector five!
ULRICH: It’s not like her to be late.
ODD: Maybe she’s with William.
I said {\i1}maybe.
AELITA: {\i1}By the way, Jeremie, have you made any\Nheadway on the antivirus recently?
JEREMIE: Well…
Actually, it’s going kind of slow. I’m missing a lot of important codes.
ODD: But with a little luck, we’ll find them today.
ULRICH: And then, it’s ciao XANA!\NWe’ll finally be able to shut down the supercomputer.
JEREMIE: We better forget about Yumi. I’m transferring you.
Transfer Odd.
Transfer Aelita.
Transfer Ulrich.
{\i1}Scanner Odd.
{\i1}Scanner Ulrich.
{\i1}Scanner Aelita.
Virtualization!
Now, head for the edge of the sector, okay?
Oh, there you are!
YUMI: Hi, Jeremie. Sorry, I--
JEREMIE: Hurry up. I’ll tell them to wait for you.
Virtualization!
ODD: A little longer, and we would’ve started the party without you.
ULRICH: Where were you?
YUMI: I had something to do.
ULRICH: Yeah, right, like being with William.
YUMI: Huh? Hey, don’t you get tired of being jealous all the time?
ULRICH: Aha, I knew it! You were with him!
YUMI: You can believe whatever you want. \NBe a jerk if you want, too.
ULRICH: {/i1}You must think I’m really dumb.
JEREMIE: Careful, you have visitors.
ODD: Hey, settle this later, okay?
I’m gonna give them a little Odd acupuncture.
ULRICH: Aelita, take cover.
ODD: Laser arrow!
One down! Great way to start off the morning.
JEREMIE: {/i1}Watch it! More Kankrelats at five o’clock!
ODD: Pretty interesting welcoming committee.
JEREMIE: {/i1}What do you expect?\NXANA hates it when we go fishing in Sector Five!
ULRICH: Two more!
ODD: Laser arrow!
JEREMIE: Oh no! The Scyphozoa!
ODD: Hm?
ULRICH: Huh?
ULRICH: Yumi!
Yumi, are you okay?
YUMI: I don’t know, I feel kind of funny.
ODD: Well anyway, it seems to have scared the Kankrelats away.
JEREMIE: Why would they go after you? We’ll abort the mission!
{/i1}Materialization Yumi!\NMaterialization Odd!
{/i1}Materialization Aelita!
ODD: You must’ve tripped on your fingers, Einstein. Yumi isn’t here.
JEREMIE: Huh?
YUMI: J-Jeremie? Is something wrong?
JEREMIE: Uh… no, I must’ve made a mistake, I’ll reboot the program!
Materialization Ulrich!\NMaterialization Yumi!
ODD: Missed again.
JEREMIE: I can’t believe it.
{/i1}Yumi, I don’t know what’s going on, I can’t devirtualize you!{/i1}
YUMI: What?
JEREMIE: {/i1}Go and hide in a tower while I figure this out!\NDirection is south southeast!
Don’t worry, I’ll find the bug. You’re safe in the tower.
YUMI: {/i1}It’s not XANA I’m worried about, Jeremie. It’s the principal.
JEREMIE: Huh?
ULRICH: Oh no, I almost forgot! Today’s the class picture!
JEREMIE: What class picture?
ODD: Hello, the ninth grade picture? It’s this morning!\NOne day suspension for any unjustified absence. Thanks a lot, Delmas.
YUMI: {/i1}Can you just picture my parents’ faces if I get suspended?
JEREMIE: I’ll do all I can, Yumi, I promise.
ODD: Hey, I have an idea. You know what a great actor I am, right?
With a wig, a dress, and a little make-up, I could take your place in the photo\Nand bam! Signed, sealed, and delivered.
YUMI: Signed, sealed, and suspended is more like it.\N{/i1}No way.
ULRICH: Hang on a second, huh? That’s not a bad idea!
ODD: There! You see? Ulrich finally admits that I’m a great actor!
ULRICH: You? You stink.
ODD: Huh?
ULRICH: But I know a really great actress.
Hi, Sissi. Say, can I talk to you for a second?
SISSI: Uh, well, yeah, of course.
ULRICH: I have something really important to ask you.
SISSI: Who, me?
ULRICH: And in exchange, I’m ready to do whatever you want.
SISSI: Anything?
ULRICH: Well, almost anything.
JEREMIE: In my opinion, when the Scyphozoa attacked you,\Nhe gave you some kind of bug, Yumi.
YUMI: {/i1}Could it have stolen some of my memory?
AELITA: That’s strange, it’s my memory that XANA seems to be after!
JEREMIE: If you ask me, the Scyphozoa took something else from you.\NStand still, I’m launching a digital analysis.
Oh no! I don’t believe it!
YUMI: What’s the matter?
JEREMIE: {/i1}The Scyphozoa stole the sequence code for your human DNA!
YUMI: What’s that?
JEREMIE: {/i1}Well, when you’re virtualized, you keep your human DNA sequence code.\NYou can’t do without it. It defines your molecular structure, which is the--
YUMI: Okay, okay, just get to the point!
JEREMIE: No DNA, no way to get back to Earth.
YUMI: Oh no!
SISSI: I’m listening.
ULRICH: Well, since Yumi can’t be here this morning,\NI’d like you to stand in for her in the ninth grade class photo.
SISSI: Okay.
ULRICH: Huh? You… you’ll do it? And, um… what do you want in exchange?
SISSI: Oh, what do you think I am? I don’t want anything at all.\NJust call it a personal favor to you and that’s that.
YUMI: Oh, this can’t be true. What about my parents, and school, and my brother?\NYou have to find a solution, Jeremie. {/i1}My whole life is on Earth!
JEREMIE: Don’t panic, Yumi. I’ll do everything I can.
AELITA: What if--
JEREMIE: You have an idea?
AELITA: I think so. Send me to Lyoko.
JEREMIE: What are you gonna do?
AELITA: Just trust me this time.
JEREMIE: Alright, I’ll bring you up close to the tower.
ULRICH: A quarter of an hour to put on a dress and a wig, unbelieveable.
SISSI: There you go, what do you think?
ODD: Not bad. The hair looks like Yumi’s.
ULRICH: Yeah, but she doesn’t dress like that. She always wears black,\Nand her dresses are longer and less…
SISSI: Less sexy? Well, why don’t you bring me one of her dresses?
ULRICH: Right, good idea, we’ll try.
ODD: Sissi’s being strangely helpful.
ULRICH: Yeah, I suppose. Weird, huh?
Cool, it’s open, I’m in! Piece of cake! Warn me if you see anyone coming.
ODD: I read you loud and clear, General!
JEREMIE: Okay, Aelita, the tower is nearby at ten o’clock.
MR. ISHIYAMA: I’ll have another Shiro-An.\NYou did a very good job on the white bean paste.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: You know, Takeo, I’ve been feeling depressed lately.\NYou don’t pay any attention to me. It’s almost as if you don’t listen to me anymore.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Mmmm, delicious.
Oh, sorry, what were you saying?
JEREMIE: {/i1}Watch out for monsters!
Aelita, now will you tell me what your idea is?
AELITA: No!
MRS. ISHIYAMA: It’s always the same thing. My mother warned \Nme not to marry a man from Tokyo.
ULRICH: Bingo!
JEREMIE: {/i1}Aelita, please tell me what you’re up to.
AELITA: There. Process launched.
YUMI: What process?
AELITA: The process of transferring my DNA \Nsequence code to your virtual structure.
JEREMIE: What? Are you crazy?
AELITA: Jeremie, Yumi’s place is on Earth. If anyone should stay on Lyoko\Nuntil we find a solution, it’s me.
JEREMIE: {/i1}I don’t agree with that! Aelita, stop it--
AELITA: I knew he was going to say that.
YUMI: You know, you’re making a big sacrifice, Aelita.
AELITA: Call it whatever you want to.
JEREMIE: Aelita, do you hear me!
Aelita! I can’t believe this!
I don’t even know how that kind of transfer works!
Oh no! This is unbelieveable!
ULRICH: Okay.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: I’ll go and wake Hiroki.
DEFAULT: (PHONE RINGS)
Yumi?
MR. ISHIYAMA: Darling? Have you seen Yumi?
MRS. ISHIYAMA: No, she must’ve left for school already. Oh, she forgot her cell phone!
ULRICH: Odd!
Odd, is that how you stand guard?
ODD: I didn’t see anybody go by\NYou got the dress?
DEFAULT: (PHONE RINGS)
ULRICH: Jeremie, Sorry, I didn’t mean to hang up on you, but it was either \N{/i1}that or getting caught by Yumi’s mom.
JEREMIE: Listen to me, Aelita is on Lyoko, transferring her \NDNA sequence code over to Yumi.
ULRICH: Uh? So what? you mean that’s not a good idea?
JEREMIE: {/i1}No, Aelita doesn’t know that when she transfers \Nher code over, her memory will be exposed.
ODD: What?
ULRICH: Are you saying that Xana will just \Nbe able to steal it at will?
JEREMIE: {/i1}That’s right, I’m sure that’s why \Nthe Scyphozoa attacked Yumi.
It’s another one of Xana’s little evil schemes .
ULRICH: Then warn Aelita, tell her to stop.
JEREMIE: I can’t, she’s cut off all communication with \Nthe tower. So you’ve got to get to Lyoko fast.
SISSI: Ok, I wouldn’t exactly call it glamorous, but it \Nwill do, you can count on me.
ULRICH: Thanks Sissi.
I owe you one.
AELITA: Only ten more minutes before the transfer.\NEverything will be just fine.
ODD: Girls! You leave em alone for five minutes, \Nand it’s mess after mess after mess.
ULRICH: Jeremie! Warm up the scanners, we’re on our way.
JEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.
Transfer Odd.
Scanner Ulrich.
{/i1}Scanner Odd.
Virtualization!
WILLIAM: Hey Yumi!\NI was looking for you in the schoolyard this morning.
Hey, wait, who are you?
DEFAULT: That’s the principle’s Daughter, it’s Elizabeth. \NToo weird.
SISSI: Listen, first of all, the name is Sissi, and \Nsecond of all, just shut up. Ok?
DEFAULT: Ok, Elizabeth.
(SMACK)
(LAUGHTER)
Ow, that hurt!
JEREMIE: {/i1}You should be able to spot the tower now.
ULRICH: There it is!
{/i1}We’ll be there in a minute!
AELITA: Just one more minute.
JEREMIE: Hurry up, hurry up!
ODD: Aelita! Stop right now!
ULRICH: If the transfer takes place, Xana will steal all of your memory.
Aelita! Stop everything right now!
JEREMIE: Huh?
Phew
AELITA: {/i1}Jeremie?
JEREMIE: Aelita, you’re so stubborn, that was a silly thing to do!
AELITA: I’m sorry, but I thought I was doing the right thing.
YUMI: I understand, and I appreciate it too.
ODD: You’re turning into a real human being.
You’re beginning to confuse generosity with stupidity.
ULRICH: Anyway, we still have no idea how to save Yumi.
JEREMIE: Don’t bet on that, I just happen to have a brilliant idea!
Xana has stolen Yumi’s DNA code sequence, \Nso it must be in his memory.
And how do we get access to Xana’s memory?
DEFAULT: Sector Five!
WILLIAM: Why are you dressed up to look like Yumi?
SISSI: It’s none of your business.
DEFAULT: Anyways, that dumb haircut of \Nyours is really old fashioned.
SISSI: I never look old fashioned. understand?
Everything looks fashionable on me.
ODD: Ugh, it’s a good thing I didn’t eat breakfast this morning.
CAMERA GUY: Quiet down!
SISSI: He’s right, shut up, will you?
MR. DELMAS: What’s all this noise about?
Yumi, is anything wrong?
Yumi, I’m speaking to you.
Sissi?
SISSI: I can explain everything, daddy, darling.
DEFAULT: Daddy, darling, daddy, darling, daddy.
(LAUGHTER)
MR. DELMAS: That’s enough.
JEREMIE: {/i1}Uh, by the way Yumi, just a little detail.
{/i1}Without your Human DNA sequence code, \Nyou’re just as vulnerable as Aelita.
If you get hit, you’ll disappear forever.
YUMI: Great.
Come On, let’s go.
JEREMIE: The countdown has started! You have \Nthree minutes to {/i1}get out of the core zone!
YUMI: First, we have to find the key.
JEREMIE: Check at the end of the corridor\NI spotted the mechanism on the wall at the end of the room.
AELITA: Yes, I see it over there.
ODD: Looks like a trap to me, but when \Nyou gotta go, you gotta go.
ULRICH: Odd!
AELITA: Watch out!
YUMI: The whole ceiling is boobytrapped, move it!
JEREMIE: Faster guys! You’ve got one minute left to turn the key!
Move it!
ODD: Timber!
ULRICH: Odd!
Huh?
JEREMIE: Odd, are you ok?
ODD: Well--
ULRICH: Ok.
JEREMIE: {/i1}Good work, Ulrich.
ULRICH: After you, ladies.
Here comes our taxi.
AELITA: We’d better not miss it.
Now!
JEREMIE: Aelita, do you know where to find Yumi’s DNA sequence code? 
AELITA:  Not really, but I’ll manage somehow.
ULRICH: A Flying Mantas nest is about to hatch, we don’t have much time left.
Uh, Yumi, I wanted to apologise for this morning. It was none of my business what you've been doing.
YUMI: That’s true, but I’ll tell you anyway.
I was buying two tickets for the Subsonics concert.
And it wasn’t easy! Bad internet connection.
Lookout, the nest just hatched!
JEREMIE: {/i1}How’s it going, Aelita?
AELITA: Nothing yet.
That’s it, I’ve got it! \NI’m sending it to you now, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: I’ve got it, Yumi.\NI’ll download it back to you in a second.
YUMI: I’m gonna be really happy to go home--
ULRICH: Yumi!
AELITA: {/i1}Did you have time to reinsert the code?
JEREMIE: I sure hope so.
{/i1}You two get outta there.
{/i1}The north tunnel, it’s open!
ULRICH: Yumi?
AELITA: It’s ok, don’t worry, she’s out \Ncold, but she’s here with us.
JEREMIE: How about you, Odd?\NHow you feeling?
ODD: Ever been flattened by a steamroller?
JEREMIE: No.
ODD: It’s simple, just get yourself devirtualized in sector five.
ULRICH: Your father caught you?
YUMI: Aw, am I going to get suspended?
SISSI: Don’t worry, I saved your day. \NI’ll get punished, but not you.
Anyway, I know how to talk to my father.
Here. Here’s your dress back.
YUMI: That uh-- That was really nice of you, Sissi.
ULRICH: Yeah, she’s right, thankyou.
SISSI: I told you you could count on me.
See ya later.
YUMI: Sissi, uh, wait.
How would you like to see the Subsonics with Ulrich?
SISSI: Are you kidding? \NGreat!
ODD: Something’s really fishy about the \Nway Sissi’s behaving.
AELITA: Maybe, deep down she’s a very nice person.
JEREMIE: Or she’s really crazy about Ulrich.
ODD: What a mess.
