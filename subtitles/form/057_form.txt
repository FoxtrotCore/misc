AELITA: {\i1}But where are we?
FRANZ: {\i1}In my laboratory.\NCome on.
AELITA: {\i1}Where?
FRANZ: {\i1}To a world where you and I will be safe.
{\i1}Forever.
{\i1}See you in a minute honey.
AELITA: {\i1}Alright then.
{\i1}Daddy?
{\i1}Daddy where are you?
FRANZ: {\i1}Here I am Aelita.
AELITA: {\i1}Daddy!
FRANZ: {\i1}I can’t materialize myself into human form yet as you can Aelita..
{\i1}I still have more work to do on Lyoko.\NThis world needs to develop more.
AELITA: {\i1}Daddy there’s some strange looking creatures over there.
FRANZ: {\i1}Run Aelita! Run!
AELITA: {\i1}Daddy!
DEFAULT: Aelita!
AELITA: Huh?
DEFAULT: You know young lady,\Nmost of us go to sleep at night.
AELITA: I’m sorry Mr. Fumet.
DEFAULT:  Scandinavian mythology, a natural disaster brings\Nabout the end of the Norse god’s world.
Scorching the earth, before a new peaceful world can arise from the ashes, called Ragnarok.
ODD: And roll.
DEFAULT: What was that?
ODD: Ragnarok and roll. It was just a joke sir.
DEFAULT: Very funny Della Robbia.
Now would you kindly leave this room?
ODD: Is that a joke?
DEFAULT: No, it’s an order.
ODD: Oh.
I guess as jokes go, is wasn’t really funny.
YUMI: So how was history class?
ULRICH: Who cares it’s history now.
SISSI: Well Ms. Einstein, better get a good night sleep.
A superbrain like yours needs a little shut eye,\Nand most of us as you know go to sleep at night.
ODD: Of course you don’t have that problem Sissi,\Ncause your brains are in your feet.
SISSI: Isn’t Odd a riot?\NLook who’s got the nerve to talk about my feet.
Especially after what Heidi Kleiner told me about yours.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
ODD: What did she mean with that?\NWhat’s wrong with with my feet?
Huh?
ULRICH: Well, to put it tactfully when you take your shoes off\Nit’s a little bit like uhh…
JEREMIE: Like a pile of very fresh manure\Nthat we just can’t seem to get away from.
ULRICH: That’s it!
ODD: Oh come on, you’re nuts!
Well, what do you know, there’s Heidi.\NNow we’ll find out.
Hey Heidi, is it true my feet smell a little?
DEFAULT: A little? Just make sure you and your sneakers\Ndon’t come within’ 50 feet of me.
(LAUGHTER)
ODD: This is a disaster.
My reputation as a superstar is at stake.\NNo girl is gonna go out with a…
JEREMIE: A walking pool of toxic waste?
ULRICH: (LAUGHTER)
ODD: Some friend you are Ulrich.
You could’ve said something, you know.\NGiven me a little hint at least.
ULRICH: It’s hard to talk when you’re holding your nose good buddy.
ODD: I thought you were trying to be funny.
YUMI: Don’t worry Odd, modern medicine must have found some kind of cure for it.
JEREMIE: Well there’s amputation for example.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
ODD: Start without me, be right there!
Emily, could I ask you something?\NWhen we went out together did you notice that uh…
DEFAULT: That your feet smell, better believe it.\NWhy do you think I kept dousing myself in perfume?
ODD: Yolanda, I’ve got a real problem.\NIt’s awful, I…
MS. YOLANDA: Yes, yes yes, yes I know.\NYou suffer from severe plantar perspiration.
ODD: Say what?
MS. YOLANDA: Your feet smell badly Odd.
ODD: Do you mean to say that everyone in school knows?
MS. YOLANDA: No, there’s uh…
Well yes, everyone does know. But don’t worry!\NI’ve seen cases that were a lot worse than yours Odd.
What’s more, I know just what to do.
FRANZ: {\i1}Aelita.
AELITA: {\i1}Daddy.
FRANZ: {\i1}Aelita I have to make contact with Xana.\NTo persuade we can live in peace with him.
AELITA: {\i1}Who’s Xana?
FRANZ: {\i1}A multiagent computer program I created.
It has achieved self-awareness and autonomy. \NAnd it’s trying to eliminate us now.
AELITA: {\i1}But why daddy?
{\i1}Daddy?
FRANZ: {\i1}Whatever you do, don’t leave this tower.
AELITA: {\i1}Daddy?
{\i1}Daddy!
{\i1}DADDY!
JEREMIE: Aelita?
Hey, what’s the matter?\NIs anything wrong?
AELITA: No, I… I was daydreaming I guess.
ODD: Hey guys, no more feet-nightmare.\NCall me ”Odorless-Odd”.
ULRICH: How did you manage that?
ODD: You’ll find out tonight. It’s a surprise.
YUMI: Well I’ll let you kick your foot problem around a little,\NI’ve got a math test.
AELITA: Jeremie, do you…
Do you think my father is still alive?
JEREMIE: Huh?
AELITA: My father, Franz Hopper.\NYou think it’s possible to rematerialize him?
JEREMIE: No. What I mean is...\NWell, there’s no way to.
AELITA: But he managed to survive when Xana captured him the first time.
Why not a second time?
JEREMIE: Your father sacrificed himself for you Aelita.
And he had to have used what every little strength he had left in him,\Nto bring you back to life.
AELITA: I know, but…
But I thought there might be a hope,\Nthat maybe you could find a way.
JEREMIE: Impossible, I checked every inch of Lyoko\Nand there isn’t the slightest sign of him.
Aelita, I’ve been working really hard in a way getting into the world wide web.\NSo we can fight Xana, and you should think the way I think.
I mean, think about the future.
AELITA: And just forget my past, huh? You think it’s easy?\NYou didn’t spend Ten years in your life as some sort of computer software.
I wish I never recovered my memory.
AELITA: {\i1}Daddy.
{\i1}Daddy! I’m coming daddy!
{\i1}Daddy!
FRANZ: {\i1}No Aelita! Get back to safety, in the tower!
{\i1}You possess the keys to Lyoko Aelita,\NXana must never get his hands on them. Do you understand?
{\i1}It’s over Aelita, Xana is too powerful.\NHe’s become a threat to all mankind. I’ve got to shut down the supercomputer.
AELITA: {\i1}But does that mean we’ll die?
FRANZ: {\i1}No, but you mustn’t forget me.\NEver. Never forget Aelita.
AELITA: {\i1}Daddy.
ODD: I knew I’d find you here.
You know, our good buddy Einstein may be good a computer-wiz\Nbut diplomatically he’s… He’s a…
AELITA: A total lameo.
ODD: But he really likes you, you know that.
AELITA: And I really like him too, I just wish he would understand it.\NMy father is all that I have left in my past life.
Odd, I have to go to Lyoko, to… To Sector Five.\NI want to try find some trace of my father.
ODD: But that may not be too easy,\Nyou heard what Jeremie said. He’s not very anxious to help.
AELITA: So we don’t need Jeremie, do we?
ODD: We?
AELITA: Just us. Just you and me, okay Odd?
ODD: Uhh…
JEREMIE: Hey Ulrich, do you think I was a bit too hard on Aelita?
ULRICH: What do you think? It wasn’t easy for her to learn that she was human.\NBetter talk to her.
JIM: No! You shouldn’t talk to anybody.
There’s no talking permitted in a library.
Anybody I find talking from now on,\Nis gonna have a little conversation with me.
And if you hadn’t had enough after our little chat,\Nyou can just walk down the hall and have a talk with the principal.
No talking!
JEREMIE: This is awful. Aelita must really hate me, huh?
ULRICH: No she doesn’t. Yeah, but she’s running around\Nlooking for you to make up right now.
YUMI: Hey William, did you study hard?
WILLIAM: Yup, just ask me anything you want\Nabout American history!
YUMI: That’s great, but uh…\NThe test is in math.
WILLIAM: Uh oh.
AELITA: Okay, I’ll launch the procedure, which’ll automatically\Nvirtualize us in the Desert Sector.
As soon as we materialize, we have one minute to get in sync with the transporter.
ODD: Wow, you know how to do all that?
AELITA: Sure.
Peace of cake.
JEREMIE: Oh no, an activated tower.\NIn the Mountain Sector.
Okay, we’re out of here.\NWe can beat Xana if we act fast.
ULRICH: Talk plan?
I’m telling you the recipe calls for eggs, vinegar, \Nwhipped cream, a little herb and peanut.
JEREMIE: And I say you gotta to use hazelnuts.
ULRICH: You don’t!
JEREMIE: You do!
ULRICH: Oh, we’re not by any chance speaking too loud, are we Jim?
JIM: I want you two out of here immediately.\NNow go on, out of my sight, you hear?
ULRICH: That was easy.
JEREMIE: Hey Ulrich, what was that recipe for anyway?\NIt sounds totally gross.
ULRICH: It’s one of Odd’s concoctions.
YUMI: Hello?
DEFAULT: Are you finished already?
Yumi?
ULRICH: She’s on her way.
JEREMIE: I can’t seem to reach Aelita.
You think she’s still mad at me?
ODD: I hope we didn’t miss our bus.
AELITA: There.
JEREMIE: Hey, do you smell that?\NIt’s weird, it smells as if Odd has been here.
ULRICH: Forget it Jeremie, Odd hasn’t been here since yesterday.\NHis feet smell but not 24 hours later.
JEREMIE: Still… It’s bizarre.
AELITA: Let’s go.
JEREMIE: Still nothing from Aelita…
...or Odd.
ULRICH: Forget it, looks as if Odd is angry as well.
JEREMIE: Cause of his smelling feet? That’s dumb.\NOdd is losing his sense of humor.
YUMI: I hope this isn’t a false alarm,\NI raced through my exam.
JEREMIE: It’s real alright. I’m sending you and Ulrich in right now.\NThe others will join you just as soon as I can get a hold of them.
Transfer, Yumi.
Transfer, Ulrich.
Virtualization.
ULRICH: Nice one Jeremie.\N{\i1}You materialized us in the middle of an airshow.
JEREMIE: Sorry you guys, but more surprises are on the way.\NXana’s called up his heavy artillery.
I’ll materialize your vehicles.
ULRICH: Better hurry.
YUMI: Look, Tarantulas!
ULRICH: Supersprint!
It’s about time.
JEREMIE: Come on Aelita,\Nyou’ve moped long enough, now pick up.
AELITA: Look, the key.\NIt’s up there!
ODD: This is almost too easy.
AELITA: Energy field!
ODD: Lazer arrow!
AELITA: Bizarre.
You think they were surprised to see us.
ODD: Sorry, we’re not disturbing you, are we?
ULRICH: I see the tower!
YUMI: So do I, but I also see a welcoming committee.
ULRICH: {\i1}Did you get a hold of Odd and Aelita?
JEREMIE: Not a word, I’ll try again. Stay in position for now.\NAnd don’t get devirtualized.
ULRICH: {\i1}We’ll try.
ODD: Aelita! Go!
JEREMIE: Huh?
What is going on around here?\NHolosphere system online?
I don’t believe this, they’re already there, traitors!
{\i1}Aelita, Odd, I know you’re there.
For your information, while you’re out there having a ball,\NXana happens to be attacking. Ulrich and Yumi are already on the spot.
ODD: What now Aelita?
AELITA: Let’s go.
JEREMIE: As soon as you get to the Dome, I’ll program a vehicle\Nand then I’ll open a tunnel. The activated tower is in the Mountain sector.
Now get going!
AELITA: Look Odd!
ODD: They’re not attacking.\NIt must be a gate.
AELITA: Jeremie, we just spotted some {\i1}flying Manta’s\Nat the South Pole of the Dome.{\i0} They seem to be guarding the entrance.
JEREMIE: Now that is not a good sign.\NHold on, I’ll check it out.
Uh oh, looks like you were right, Xana’s attacking the core of Lyoko.\N{\i1}The tower in the Mountain sector was just a diversion.
ODD: Okay, we’re on it.
ULRICH: Impact!
Your telekinesis thing is really cool.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Ulrich, Yumi,{\i0} change of plans. Listen up.\NOdd and Aelita are in Sector Five, you gotta get over there they need some help.
ULRICH: {\i1}What? What’s going on?
JEREMIE: I’ll tell you all about it later but for now, get going.
AELITA: Odd, it’s suicide.
ODD: You’re kidding.
This is a snap, Aelita.
YUMI: Xana really outsmarted us.
While he kept us busy in Mountain sector,\Nhe was free to attack the Core of Lyoko.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Yeah, but he didn’t count on two scanner stoleways\Nalready{\i0} being in Sector Five. Fortunately.
ULRICH: {\i1}So then you’re not mad at them.
JEREMIE: Not a chance.\NIn fact, as soon as they get here they each get a big kiss.
Are you at the extreme edge of the sector?
ULRICH: {\i1}Sir, yes sir.
JEREMIE: Okay, then I’ll enter the code SCIPIO.
ODD: These guys are tough to get a handle on.
AELITA: You know, you might try throwing one of your shoes at them.
ODD: Very funny, I hit them better than that.
Laser arrow!
AELITA: Odd!
JEREMIE: {\i1}Hurry up, Aelita’s all alone!
And the first shield layer of the core of Lyoko has just given away.
{\i1}Aelita, where are you?
AELITA: In trouble!
Energy field!
JEREMIE: Hang on!\NYumi and Ulrich are on their way.
ULRICH: Supersprint!
Well, did we miss much of the show?
AELITA: No, just the opening act.
ULRICH: My saber!
JEREMIE: Nice one everybody.\NAelita, you know that you still have a tower to deactivate.
{\i1}But if you wanna stop at a terminal first to collect some new data\Non Franz Hopper, I mean… If you want to.
AELITA: Yeah, why not?
ULRICH: Okay then, so what’s this miracle cure Yolanda gave you?
ODD: Hold on, I did tell you it was a surprise.\NNow close your eyes Ulrich.
ULRICH: I’d rather close my nose, I think.
Ugh, what’s that foul odor?
ODD: It’s the cream. Pretty effective, huh?\NNow my feet don’t smell at all.
ULRICH: That’s because the stench of that cream is so horribly strong.\NHelp, open a window or I’ll die.
ODD: Some guys are never satisfied.
AELITA: Any luck?
JEREMIE: No, nothing.
Hold on a second, what’s that?
AELITA: What have you found?
JEREMIE: A fragment of a DNA code sequence that belongs to Franz Hopper.\NYou were right Aelita.
AELITA: My father might still be alive somewhere on Lyoko.
