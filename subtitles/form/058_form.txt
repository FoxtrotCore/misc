ODD: Forget it Urlich, your saber may have some class, but compared to my laser arrows, you monster count is way behind mine.
ULRICH: Oh yeah? I bet that you forgot that my saber saved you from a quick game over last time.
JEREMIE: You know what? I made up a little statistics program that I’m using to record your performance on Lyoko for the last few weeks. 
So tonight, if you want, we can compare and see who’s best. 
ODD: That’s great, I really love stats. We’ll finally have proof of my superiority. But in any event, I’ve got something that you’ll never have, good buddy, and that’s style.
ULRICH: Style, my friend, doesn’t impress a megatank.
NICHOLAS:: Hey, what’s all this about a megatank, huh?
You talking about a videogame?
ODD: Yeah, teddy bear heaven, way too complicated for you.
HERB: Very funny Della Robbia.
JOHNNY: Uh Ulrich, have you got a minute? Can I talk to you in private?
URLICH:: I’m listening.
JOHNNY: Um well you’re uh Yumi’s best friend, aren’t you?
ULRICH: Yeah, I guess you might say that.
JOHNNY: Um, um, what I want to say, um, is that when I see Yumi--\NI mean, I’m-I mean, well, I’d like to--
You remember the episode of Hospital of Horrors that was on last week?
ULRICH: Huh? You’d like to give Yumi a transfusion of French poodle’s blood?
JOHNNY: No no, no I mean at the end, what happens between Stacy and Dr. Shrank.
URLICH: Listen I don’t remember what happened at the end,\Nand I don’t know what you’re talking about.
And they’ve got pancakes for breakfast. So hurry up, will ya?
ODD: You look happy for a change. What’s going on? what did Johnny want?
ULRICH: Just to talk, he’s totally flipped out over Yumi.
AELITA: That’s adorable. So what did you tell him?
JEREMIE: You did let him down gently without laughing at him.
ULRICH:: You’re kidding, I wasn’t going to pass this up. I told him to follow her nonstop.
AELITA: That wasn’t very cool, Ulrich, Yumi hates to be followed around. She’ll probably tell him to get lost.
URLICH: So what if she does?
JEREMIE: You know Ulrich, you can be a real jerk sometimes.
ULRICH: Hey come on, it’s just a little bit of hazing, I got hazed when I was in seventh grade.
ODD: Hazing, huh? Sounds more like jealousy to me. I don’t believe it, you flip out even when Kiwi looks at Yumi.
ULRICH: Hey, don’t forget that Yumi and I are just friends, and that’s all.
SFX: (BIRD CAW)
JOHNNY: Uh, hi Yumi.
YUMI: Hello.
JOHNNY: Do you mind if I sit down next to you for a second, Yumi? It’s really nice to see you.
YUMI: Hm, that’s great, but happen to be reading.
JOHNNY: You know, I love to read too, I read all kinds of stuff, books and magazines, and comics. Do you like comics?
I like mangas best. What about you? I’ll bet you know some great ones. Can you recommend any to me?
YUMI: No, see I’m going to lunch.
JOHNNY: I’ll go with you.
I like the idea of self service. Don’t you, huh?\NOh you’re having salad? Great idea, vegetables are good for you, lots of vitamins.
I’m gonna have the-- Hey wait for me.
I can’t believe that you like brussel sprouts too. We have so much in common, it’s amazing.
ODD: Hey, don’t that in Sector Five, I took out at least three flying mantas in a matter of seconds.
URLICH: I don’t trust your count, you stink in math, I prefer Jeremie’s stats.
JOHNNY: Where’s your table? I’d really like to sit with you.
YUMI: And I’d like to get some water.
ULRICH: How’s it going, Johnny?
JOHNNY: Huh? Sure, but I have the feeling I’m getting on her nerves by following her.
ULRICH: Oh no, you know what girls are like. Come on, don’t let it get you down, buddy.
Now when you guys get to they gym, ask her for all kinds of advice.
JOHNNY: Ok.
Great idea. Could I have some water?
JEREMIE: I think I got question two right, I said that China stretched over the large river valleys of Eastern Asia, like the Hwang Ho, Chang Xi'an, and the Xiang.
AELITA: What about you, Odd? How did you do on question three?
ODD: Simple, I said China was the most populated country in the world, with a billion people per square meter.
SFX: (LAUGHTER)
ODD: You mean I got it wrong?
ULRICH: I guess I was right not to trust your stats, huh?\N(LAUGHING)
SFX: (BIRD CAWS)
ULRICH: Hey guys, have you noticed all those birds? It’s kind of bizarre.
ODD: It reminds me of a film, a dumb flick where birds attack the heros. It wasn’t even scary.
SFX: (CLAPPING)\NJOHNNY: Fantastic.
YUMI: Johnny, you wouldn’t be planning on following all over, all the time.
JOHNNY: Well, yeah.
SFX: (BIRD CAWING)\N(ELECTRIC CRACKLING)
JEREMIE: I saw the sign, it was in their eyes, it’s Xana!
SFX: (BIRD SCREECHING)
ODD: Hurry, they’ll peck away at us until there’s nothing left.
ULRICH: Ow!
ODD: I take it all back, it wasn’t a dumb film after all.
Head for the passage, I’ll try to lure them over to my side.\NCome on little birdies, over here.
ULRICH: Odd, come on, we’re here!
ODD: Give me a second to finish my acupuncture session.
JEREMIE: Incredible, I forget to check the superscan for a few hours, and bang, a Xana attack.
AELITA: Don’t worry, everything will be just fine once we get the tower deactivated.
YUMI: Go on, your turn.
JOHNNY: (SCREAMING)
SFX: (PHONE RINGING)
YUMI: Odd? What, a big flock of birds?\NOk, I’ll be right there.
JOHNNY: Yumi, wait up.
YUMI: No don’t follow me--\NSFX: (GLASS SHATTERING)
YUMI:: Johnny, get going, it’s me that they’re after!
SFX: (GLASS SHATTERING)
ODD: I don’t believe it.
AELITA: We’ve been through worse. besides, it’s not every day we have such a big audience.
SFX: (BIRD SCREECHING)
URLICH: We’ll delay them, head for the elevator, see you later.
ODD: Over here, we’re waiting!
(SCREAMING)
JEREMIE: Ulrich, Odd, hurry up!
Faster, faster!
SFX: (BEAKS PECKING ON METAL)
ULRICH: I don’t know, but if you’re trying to cheat, don’t forget that the birds aren’t part of the stats, only monsters sent by Xana.
AELITA: Yumi’s all on her own, I hope she’s ok.
SFX: (PHONE RINGING)\N(HOARD OF WINGS FLAPPING)
AELITA: There’s no answer.
JEREMIE: Don’t panic, I’ll virtualize in the vicinity of the activated tower, and then I’ll call Yumi.
YUMI: Too late.
SFX: (GLASS SHATTERING)\N(HOARD OF WINGS FLAPPING)
JEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.
{\i1}Transfer Aelita.
{\i1}Transfer Odd.
Scanner Ulrich.
{\i1}Scanner Aelita.\NScanner Odd.
{\i1}Virtualization!
{\i1}the activated tower is South-Southwest, in a crater.
ODD: Start up the stat program, Einstein.
ULRICH: You’re going to cry when you see the results.
ODD: I doubt it, buddy, but besides, I don’t cry when I get bad grades, do I?
ULRICH: If you did, you’d have drowned in your tears  ages ago.
JEREMIE: You can start earning your points now. \NXana sent you a big welcome party of Krabs.
ODD: Let’s go, Ulrich, I’ll leave you the claws.
ULRICH: We’ll see about that.
ODD: May the best man win, and that’s me!\NBonzai!
ULRICH: Cheater.
ODD: Huh? Where are they? I don’t see anything.
ULRICH: Is that what you mean by style, huh?
ODD: Go on then, see if you can do any better.
JIM: What is all this about crows with red eyes?
JOHNNY: But it’s true, I swear, they flew into the gym and attacked Yumi!
look at the windows.
JIM: Ah!\NSFX: (HOARD OF WINGS FLAPPING)
JOHNNY: There, you see?
JIM: Yumi!
SFX: (PHONE RINGING)
DELMAS: Hello?
JEREMIE: Mr. Delmas, is that you?
DELMAS: Yes, it’s me.
JEREMIE: Uh, do you know where Yumi is?
DELMAS: Yes, she’s here, in the toolshed, and she’s been hurt.
JIM: Mr. Delmas, we have to get her to the hospital.
DELMAS: Listen Belpois, I’m too busy to talk to you at this time, I have to call an ambulance, so hang up please.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, Odd, Aelita, can you hear me?\NYumi’s been hurt, I have to launch a return to the past, first you’ve gotta deactivate the tower, fast.
ULRICH: Ok.
Leave em to me.\NODD; huh?
ULRICH: Impact!
Bullseye
ODD: That’s not fair!
(LAUGHING)
ULRICH: (LAUGHING)
JEREMIE: Ulrich and Odd, would you mind concentrating? 
Do I have to remind you there’s a tower to deactivate if you want to save Yumi?
ODD: Laser Arrow!
That’s one less monster. Odd the great, the brave, the magnificent, has finally overcome his handicap and has now caught up with his opponent. Temporarily ofcourse, because odd--
(SCREAMING)
ULRICH: So long Odd, the mega--
ODD: That wasn’t fair.
JEREMIE: Careful Ulrich, you’re losing too many life points.
ULRICH: Hey, Aelita, you’re cheating!
AELITA: Yeah I know, but you guys are just too clumsy.
JEREMIE: Nice one, Aelita.
SFX: (BIRD CAW)
(HOARD OF WINGS FLAPPING)
AELITA: Tower deactivated.
ULRICH: It’s ok Jeremie, you can launch a return to the past now.
Jeremie?
Jeremie! do you read us, Jeremie?
DELMAS: Can you make anything out of this attack by birds with electric beaks, Jim?
JIM: No, never seen anything like it, sir, except when I investigated paranormal phenomena for a highly special secret service section.
DELMAS: I didn’t know that.
JIM: I did, but I would rather not talk about it. It’s a classified defense secret.
ODD: I don’t believe this, Jeremie!
AELITA: Ulrich.
ULRICH: Aelita!
Oh no.
ODD: Ulrich, can you hear me? Jeremie’s out cold, the birds have attacked him.
ULRICH: Oh great, Xana’s captured Aelita, I’ve got hornets on my tail, and my saber’s gone. Do something!
ODD: I’d love to, but the supercomputer programs aren’t exactly my thing. I could try to get your saber back.
ULRICH: No.
I don’t believe it.\NSuper sprint!
YUMI: Huh? You’re still here? 
JOHNNY: Sure I am, I wouldn’t leave you, Yumi.
YUMI: Where’d you get this stupid idea to follow me from?
JOHNNY: From Ulrich, he said it was the best way to get your attention, and so that’s what I’ve been doing.
YUMI: I should have guessed it was from him, he’s not only jealous, he’s dumb.
JOHNNY: Ulrich’s jealous? But of what?
YUMI: Forget it.
ULRICH: I may not have my saber, but I can run.
Odd, we can’t take the chance of Aelita going into the waytower.\NYou’ve gotta try to launch a return in time.
ODD: I thought we were never to that when she’s under Xana’s control.
ULRICH: At least try to program me a saber.
ODD: I’m almost there.\NAnd here we go.
ULRICH: Great, Odd. 
Huh? Ok, I take that back.
ODD: Uh, sorry.
Let me see, how are we going to get out of this one?
It’s time for some strong arm tactics.
ULRICH: You’re beginning to get on my nerves.
Ah you missed. Missed again. Tough break.
ODD: Come on Jeremie, this is the tenth slap, don’t tell me you need a real smash.
JEREMIE: Odd, are you crazy or what?
JOHNNY: Yumi.
ULRICH: I’m not going to let you through, Aelita.
One, and two, but--\Noh no.
JOHNNY: Hang in there Yumi.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, I’m ready for action again.\NTell me what’s going on, do you need help?
ULRICH: Too late.
Come on, Aelita, this is no time to drag your feet.
DOCTOR: What do we got here?\NORDERLY: Adolescent girl, about 14, multiple injuries, unconscious.
JEREMIE: It’s all over.
ODD: For the Desert Sector, yes, for Yumi, I hope not, so move it.
JEREMIE: Return to the past now.
HERB: Very funny Della Robbia.
ULRICH: Well?
JEREMIE: It’s ok, yumi’s going to be fine.
ODD: Phew
JEREMIE: Yeah, but she knows about what you told Johnny to do, and she’s furious.
ODD: Don’t say we didn’t warn you.
JOHNNY: Ulrich, Ulrich, have you got a minute?\NCan I talk to you in private?
ULRICH: No problem.
JOHNNY: Well, well you see, when I see Yumi I--
ULRICH: Ok, I get it, you like her, and you don’t know how to get her to notice you, right?
JOHNNY: That’s it, but how did you guess?
ULRICH: Instinct. There’s one thing that can’t fail.
JOHNNY: Sure?
ULRICH: She’s gonna love it, trust me. Now you’ve gotta go find her and tell her this.
JOHNNY: Ok, right, uh-- Ulrich is a really dumb jerk,\Nand he wants to apologize for pulling such a stupid stunt.
YUMI: Ok, well why don’t you sit down? We can study together.
JOHNNY: Together, like us? Like you and me? together?
YUMI: Why not?
JOHNNY: Wow, that Ulrich really rocks.
YUMI: I guess.
JEREMIE: Hey guys, I got the latest stats on the Lyoko battles.
ODD: Ready to eat your hat good buddy?
ULRICH: You’re the one who’s not going to be able to digest this. 
JEREMIE: The Lyoko warrior who has outclassed all the others is Aelita!
DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)
ODD: I don’t believe in statistics, they don’t mean a thing.\NThat’s not the way to determine a real Lyoko Hero.
ULRICH: Yeah, for once I agree with you, Odd.
