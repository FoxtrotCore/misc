I’ll get you this time,

You mind telling me

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
what you’re doing
outside at this hour?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

I hope this will teach you
a lesson, Jeremie.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don’t understand.
A model student like you?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should be ashamed.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uh…yes, sir.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-What did he say?
-Well, tell us!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He gave me detention
for the whole week of vacation.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Cool!

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He really let you have it!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As punishments go,
you’re a champion!

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I’m sure we couldn’t have
done better than that!

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, XANA won’t get
any vacation this time.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Am I dreaming,
or does Jeremie look happy

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
to be punished
for the vacatoin?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, it sure is weird.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You’d almost think
he did what he did

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
because he wanted
to be punished.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don’t get it.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And who’s this XANA
he was talking about?

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Herb is right. It’s even
weirder than weird.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I’m gonna find out
just what’s going on.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Huh? What are you
gonna do?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don’t you have to leave
with your dad after school?

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A little change of schedule.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Daddy, can I talk
to you for a minute?

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, Sissi dear,
I am very busy.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It won’t take long.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, you see, there’s this girl I know
whose grades aren’t very good,

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and the best thing for her
would be to study over the vacation,

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
but she’s supposed to
go to see her grandparents.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see. And who is this--?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shh! I’m coming to that!

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She knows that when she
gets to her grandparents’ house,

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
she won’t feel like studying,
so what do you think she should do?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She needs your advice as a principal!

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, my advice would be
to give up her vacation

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and stay home and study
for her own good.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What’s this girl’s name?
Perhaps I could talk to her…

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just did, daddy! It’s me!

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you for the advice!
I promise to study hard!

68

Yumi’s off for a vacation
in the mountains, and what do I get?

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A whole week of math tutoring.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If they think they can make

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
a good student
out of you in one week,

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
well, I say good luck to them.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It sounds like mission
impossible if you ask me.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You’re sure you can manage
on your own without us?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No sweat, and if XANA
leaves me alone,

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I’ll be able to work on
Aelita’s materialization.

Oh, don’t worry.
He’s not gonna be alone.

I’m staying at school, too,
and I’ll look after him.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I’ll be his guardian angel.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow, Jeremie, are you lucky.

gonna clean itself?

to monitor your studying,

Okay, now.

Get to work
and clean that up.

I don’t know why,
but all of a sudden,

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
my math tutoring
doesn’t seem all that bad.

95

Come on, you can do
better than that!

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A little more elbow grease!

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep scrubbing.
Go on, you can do it.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How’s that math problem?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Making any progress solving it?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I sure hope so!

Well, I’m a little bit stuck here.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe if I gave
Jeremie some help.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My father always says that
manual labor is good for the brain!

Huh, I guess all kids
aren’t lazy, after all.

I’ll go and get you a sponge.

Oh, what a shame
to have to wipe all that off.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess I’m not the first one
to recognize your talent.

It’s really well done.
A work of art.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, did you do it
all by yourself?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or did your friend XANA
help you a little, huh?

(SINISTER MUSIC)

to the other kids about XANA.

Is she your girlfriend?
Maybe I know her.

Come on, Jeremie, tell me.

117

that you listen to,

possibly know them.

volunteered to help me.

tries something tonight!

I'm sure of that.

this XANA is in on it.

of Jeremie and his weird friends!

I know I’m on the right track,

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
but I need the computer in the lab
to check out the figures.

145

I’m gonna head over to the factory.

that you were sleepwalking

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
because I’ve been
working here for 20 years,

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and I’ve heard that story about…

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jim, something awful has happened!

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a look! In there!

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Huh?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looks like there was a hurricane in there.
This had better not be your doing.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the smoke! It’s disappeared!

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That’s weird. Not even a trace.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It’s XANA.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don’t even think about leaving this room.
Tomorrow, I’m calling your parents.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You’ve got some explaining to do.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn’t want to be in your shoes.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aelita! Come in, please. Hurry.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We’ve got a big problem.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You’re not the only one. 
XANA’s woken up.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I don’t know which tower he’s activated.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the pulsation converge in this direction.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It’s even worse than I thought.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The spilled bottles contain
an extremely poisonous substance.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If the computer is right,
the gas can even be deadly

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
in cases of extended inhalation.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up, young man. Time to face the music.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Huh?

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeremie!

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
W-What’s happening? Where am I?

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeremie!

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can’t see. I’m totally out of it!

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What’s going on?

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(SCREAMS)

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jim! Over there! Smoke! With arms!

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This has got to be contagious.
What’s all this about smoke, anyway?

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, I don’t see any--

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waaaah!

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bingo.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aelita, I found it.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
37 degrees south in the forest area.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I’m on my way.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I’m nowhere near it,
and I’m gonna need some help.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know three volunteers who will be happy
to cut their vacation short and help.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You’ll soon learn that mathematics
is actually quite easy, young man.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All you need is a sense of logic,
a little bit of common sense,

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and, of course, if you have good
concentration skills, and if you have…

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
“S.O.S XANA--Jeremie.”

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
…analysis, that will help as well,
but I assure you, if you apply yourself,

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
it’s not at all complicated.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, come and have a look at this, Charlie.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow, that’s incredible!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is that, kid?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uh…it’s a…

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looks like a skeleton!

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, that’s right, but, uh,
don’t you see anything strange?

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your skeleton is moving.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, that’s Kiwi!

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kiwi’s my dog.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You do know that dogs are only
allowed in the luggage compartment?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, yeah sure, uh…

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don’t know what happened!

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was supposed to stay here…

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
with my grandma, but…

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mhmm.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, it’s gram!

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We were just talking about you!

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you talking about, Odd?

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It’s me, Jeremie.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, of course I know it’s you, gram!

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I’m sorry.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you’ve told me a hundred times
that you don’t like me to call you gram!

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, okay.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I’m on my way. Right.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I’ll bring back the dog.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye, gram.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We should have left over two hours ago.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know how much she loves that dress.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don’t even know
what dress she’s talking about.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I’m coming! I’ll be down in two seconds!

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, I doubt that.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You’re going to laugh,
darling, when I tell you…

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I don’t really feel like laughing.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you noticed someone
is missing in the back seat?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, no!

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(COUGHING)

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over here. Hurry up!

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeremie, I’m coming into the forest area now.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yumi, Ulrich, and Odd
should be there very soon.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be careful, Aelita.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There are bound to be monsters around there.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I better go back to the school.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jim and Sissi might be in trouble.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I’ve got to warn them.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Help! Help us!

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Help!

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It’s not use. We’re finished.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, no. We’re not finished.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be brave, now.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeremie can’t be far away.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He’ll help us out of this!

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeremie? That’s pretty reassuring.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It’s nice to know that the closest thing
to Bruce Willis is coming to the rescue.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sissi? Jim? Where are you?

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We’ll cut across through
the boiler room. It's faster.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(COUGHING)

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Through the park.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeremie!

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jim and Sissi are still inside.
We’ve got to find them.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I’ll go.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ulrich, wait!

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yumi, the factory.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You’ve got to go and help Aelita.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hang on, Jeremie.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Odd, you got here in the nick of time.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where’s Ulrich?

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I only stayed at school to try and find out
the secret of Jeremie and his friends

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
because the truth is that I’ve been wanting
to be part of their group for ages,

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
but it seems so hopeless.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you understand what I mean?

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Huh? No.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All I understand is that
there’s no ventilation in here.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We’re gonna run out of oxygen soon.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I’d better stop talking then, right?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. I can take a hint.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A strange and toxic smoke
whose origins are unknown.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The elderly and children
are advised to remain indoors.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Odd.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Help me get over to the computer.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(COUGHING)

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And get ready to dive in.
Stop looking at me! Come on!

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There’s no time to lose!

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Transfer Yumi.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Transfer Odd.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scanner Yumi.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scanner Odd.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Virtualization.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where do we go now?

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The activated tower is over this way.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, Aelita!

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you seen any monsters?

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not yet.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess you didn’t look very hard!

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ulrich, do you copy?

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How’s it going?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Still nothing.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I’ve been through most of the building.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ulrich, get out of there.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can’t stay in that smoke any longer.
It's too dangerous.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And they may be outside already.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I-I’ll try one last room. Then I’ll go.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(COUGHING)

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jim!

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jim! Sissi! Are you in there?

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ulrich, get out right now!

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ulrich! Come on!

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What’s going on!

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ulrich, answer me!

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look, I don’t want
to rush you, my friends,

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
but it’s getting kind of urgent here.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about us?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think we’re doing, huh?

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Getting a suntan?

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Odd, watch out.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You okay, Yumi?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No broken bones yet.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take good care of Aelita.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There. You see, Sissi?

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you he’d come and rescue us.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What the…Ulrich!

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He came for me!

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, he came to save me!
It’s just like I always dreamed!

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The only way to access the tower
is via a tree bridge.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it happens to be behind the monsters,

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and so you’re gonna have to
find a way around them.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I might have an idea
for blocking the monsters.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You take care of Aelita.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Laser flash!

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yumi! If she gets hit one more time…

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeremie!

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Welcome to Earth, Yumi.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, look. A cell phone!

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now we’ll be able to
call for help.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jim, is that you, huh?

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeremie!

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you? And Ulrich?

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeremie, we really need help.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We’re starting to run out of oxygen in here.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, no!

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jim, what’s happening?

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jim!

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Odd, hurry up!

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, what do we do now?

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You take care of the monsters.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(CELESTIAL HUMMING)

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, you!

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That’s right. You.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Laser flash!

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let’s hope it’s not too late.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aelita, hurry up!

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Return to the past now.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don’t understand why you insist on

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
getting punished with
detention again, Jeremie.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, XANA’s not
gonna reactivate this soon.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could get yourself a short vacation.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not as long as Aelita stays virtual.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And this time, to tell you the truth,

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
considering what we’ve painted,
Jim can’t be too angry!

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come to think of it,
I’m gonna stick around.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anything is better than another one
of Mrs. Schmitt’s math lessons.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even Jim.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(BARKING)

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get back here!
