<i>What about the mantas?
How are we doing?</i>

13
0:1:11,500 --> 0:1:13,620
Looks like they're
gonna hatch real soon.

14
0:1:13,620 --> 0:1:15,610
And judging by
the size of the nest,

15
0:1:15,610 --> 0:1:17,880
We're gonna have some
big bouncing babies!

16
0:1:19,750 --> 0:1:21,360
Okay. That's it for now, Aelita.

17
0:1:21,360 --> 0:1:22,780
Just a little longer, Jeremie.

18
0:1:22,780 --> 0:1:25,30
We've never been able
to access this much data!

19
0:1:25,510 --> 0:1:27,280
<i>Let me take over now, okay?</i>

20
0:1:28,640 --> 0:1:31,480
Aelita, listen, I don't want
to rush you, but uh…

21
0:1:42,0 --> 0:1:43,650
Jeremie, they're here.

22
0:1:43,650 --> 0:1:45,480
Okay. I've got things under control.

23
0:1:46,770 --> 0:1:48,560
Three vehicles coming right up!

24
0:2:12,830 --> 0:2:14,90
Wow!

25
0:2:14,90 --> 0:2:16,840
Still just babies and check 'em out!

26
0:2:16,840 --> 0:2:18,220
What do you think they are?

27
0:2:18,220 --> 0:2:19,590
Male or female?

28
0:2:19,590 --> 0:2:22,110
Considering their tempers,
they've got to be girls, right?

29
0:2:22,110 --> 0:2:23,150
Just watch.

30
0:2:23,150 --> 0:2:25,380
I'll show 'em what is it to be a guy.

31
0:2:25,980 --> 0:2:29,130
Jeremie, tell me, do I
really need to hear this?

32
0:2:29,130 --> 0:2:32,320
Uh, sorry, Yumi, but you
can't always choose your friends!

33
0:2:32,320 --> 0:2:34,180
Anyway, the tunnel will be open soon.

34
0:2:59,30 --> 0:3:0,860
Just in time!

35
0:3:1,480 --> 0:3:2,950
<i>Okay. The tunnels are open.</i>

36
0:3:2,950 --> 0:3:5,200
The mantas shouldn't follow you inside.

37
0:3:9,980 --> 0:3:11,280
And there you go.

38
0:3:11,280 --> 0:3:13,250
The data analysis program is running.

39
0:3:13,250 --> 0:3:14,480
Great!

40
0:3:15,0 --> 0:3:16,470
And what does that mean exactly?

41
0:3:16,470 --> 0:3:18,400
With all the data that
we've been able to recover,

42
0:3:18,400 --> 0:3:20,980
I've got a good chance of
finding the antivirus.

43
0:3:20,980 --> 0:3:22,910
You mean that pretty soon we'll be able

44
0:3:22,910 --> 0:3:24,920
to shut down the super calculator?

45
0:3:24,920 --> 0:3:25,750
Exactly.

46
0:3:25,750 --> 0:3:26,840
And if it works,

47
0:3:26,840 --> 0:3:30,200
Aelita will no longer be tied 
to XANA by that horrible virus.

48
0:3:30,200 --> 0:3:30,960
Oh, shoot.

49
0:3:30,960 --> 0:3:32,510
What are we gonna do
with our free time?

50
0:3:32,510 --> 0:3:34,640
I mean, if we can't
save the world anymore…

51
0:3:34,640 --> 0:3:36,150
You might study a little more.

52
0:3:36,150 --> 0:3:37,720
And learn something for once.

53
0:3:38,150 --> 0:3:39,790
3 AM? Wow.

54
0:3:39,790 --> 0:3:42,500
We'd better head for our rooms
if we don't want to get caught.

55
0:3:43,280 --> 0:3:44,440
<i>Well, good night.</i>

56
0:3:44,440 --> 0:3:45,750
<i>You mean what's left of it.</i>

57
0:3:48,370 --> 0:3:49,800
Jeremie, do you really think

58
0:3:49,800 --> 0:3:51,860
that your calculations
will lead to something?

59
0:3:51,860 --> 0:3:54,580
We can't be 100 percent
sure, but I think so.

60
0:3:54,580 --> 0:3:57,450
I can't believe that
soon I'll be really real.

61
0:3:57,450 --> 0:3:59,740
Well, to me, you already are.

62
0:3:59,740 --> 0:4:1,970
Very real. I mean it.

63
0:4:1,970 --> 0:4:4,780
And to everyone else,
you're Aelita Stones.

64
0:4:4,780 --> 0:4:5,700
Odd's cousin.

65
0:4:5,700 --> 0:4:7,660
You know very well that isn't true.

66
0:4:7,660 --> 0:4:10,990
But a lie that everyone believes
isn't really a lie anymore.

67
0:4:10,990 --> 0:4:12,240
Hey, don't worry, Aelita.

68
0:4:12,240 --> 0:4:13,800
Tomorrow's gonna be a great day.

69
0:4:13,800 --> 0:4:15,0
Believe me.

70
0:4:15,0 --> 0:4:15,680
Good night.

71
0:4:15,680 --> 0:4:16,990
Good night, Jeremie.

72
0:4:18,440 --> 0:4:20,700
This time, I've got 'em.

73
0:4:34,460 --> 0:4:36,120
It's Tuesday already!

74
0:4:36,120 --> 0:4:37,240
No, you're not dreaming!

75
0:4:37,240 --> 0:4:39,200
Or, rather, you're
not dreaming anymore!

76
0:4:39,200 --> 0:4:42,530
It's already 7 o'clock in
the morning on <i>Sky Radio</i>.

77
0:4:42,530 --> 0:4:43,880
Look out your window!

78
0:4:43,880 --> 0:4:46,120
The sun is shining,
the birds are singing,

79
0:4:46,120 --> 0:4:48,470
and me, I'm talking,
talking, talking!

80
0:4:48,470 --> 0:4:50,360
To keep you from
falling back to sleep!

81
0:4:50,360 --> 0:4:52,200
You bunch of lazy bones!

82
0:4:52,200 --> 0:4:54,940
It's a great day that's
gonna start off great

83
0:4:54,940 --> 0:4:56,480
Thanks to <i>Sky Radio</i>

84
0:4:56,480 --> 0:4:58,800
with the Subsonics' latest hit!
Here it comes--

85
0:4:58,800 --> 0:5:1,350
Hmph. I can't help but wonder
what a girl your age

86
0:5:1,350 --> 0:5:3,870
could possibly be doing out
at such a late hour.

87
0:5:3,870 --> 0:5:5,930
There's a boy behind this, isn't there!

88
0:5:6,500 --> 0:5:8,840
I couldn't exactly tell them that
there were three friends involved

89
0:5:8,840 --> 0:5:10,420
and all of them boys, could I?

90
0:5:10,420 --> 0:5:12,0
That would've really freaked them out.

91
0:5:12,0 --> 0:5:13,790
Why don't you just make up a story?

92
0:5:13,790 --> 0:5:15,820
I do it all the time with my parents.

93
0:5:15,820 --> 0:5:16,930
I'm sick of lying.

94
0:5:16,930 --> 0:5:19,200
I-I'd love to be able to
tell them everything.

95
0:5:19,200 --> 0:5:20,100
Like I used to.

96
0:5:20,100 --> 0:5:21,160
Don't worry, Yumi!

97
0:5:21,160 --> 0:5:23,170
Soon, you won't have to lie any more.

98
0:5:23,170 --> 0:5:24,440
Come on! Cheer up!

99
0:5:24,440 --> 0:5:25,890
It's gonna be a great day!

100
0:5:25,890 --> 0:5:27,320
They said so on the radio!

101
0:5:27,320 --> 0:5:29,630
Don't you think Jeremie
looks happy this morning?

102
0:5:29,630 --> 0:5:31,430
Not for long.

103
0:5:35,260 --> 0:5:36,360
Hey!

104
0:5:35,260 --> 0:5:36,360
Whoa!

105
0:5:36,360 --> 0:5:39,160
Jeremie, would you listen
to something for me?

106
0:5:39,160 --> 0:5:40,880
You'll see.
There's not a lot of music,

107
0:5:40,880 --> 0:5:43,530
But the words are really interesting.

108
0:5:45,50 --> 0:5:46,950
She taped the whole conversation.

109
0:5:46,950 --> 0:5:49,170
But what does she want exactly?

110
0:5:49,170 --> 0:5:51,810
She wants to be a part of our group.

111
0:5:51,810 --> 0:5:55,320
And that we explain everything
to her from A to Z.

112
0:5:55,320 --> 0:5:58,410
If not, she'll tell her father everything.

113
0:5:58,760 --> 0:6:0,810
She's even worse than I thought.

114
0:6:0,810 --> 0:6:2,30
Excuse me, you three,

115
0:6:2,30 --> 0:6:4,470
but do you mind if I teach a class here?

116
0:6:4,470 --> 0:6:6,800
Not at all, mam.
After all, it <i>is</i> your job.

117
0:6:6,800 --> 0:6:9,320
Yes, and my job is also to
ask questions, isn't it, Odd?

118
0:6:9,320 --> 0:6:10,930
So, would you be
kind enough to tell me

119
0:6:10,930 --> 0:6:13,870
the mass and moles
of two oxygen atoms?

120
0:6:13,870 --> 0:6:15,590
Um…um…

121
0:6:15,590 --> 0:6:17,510
32 grams per mole.

122
0:6:17,510 --> 0:6:19,640
And the principle of photosynthesis?

123
0:6:20,140 --> 0:6:21,750
Uh…you mean…

124
0:6:21,750 --> 0:6:23,660
The synthesis of oxygen for plants

125
0:6:23,660 --> 0:6:25,660
possessing chlorophyll placed in light.

126
0:6:25,660 --> 0:6:27,400
Alright, here's an easy one now.

127
0:6:27,400 --> 0:6:29,280
Which student in this graduating class

128
0:6:29,280 --> 0:6:31,190
is the biggest failure in science

129
0:6:31,190 --> 0:6:33,240
who nevertheless takes the liberty

130
0:6:33,240 --> 0:6:35,840
of not listening to my lessons?

131
0:6:35,840 --> 0:6:38,520
Um…me, Misses Hertz?

132
0:6:38,520 --> 0:6:40,160
Bravo. Well done, Odd.

133
0:6:40,160 --> 0:6:42,840
You see what you can do
when you apply yourself?

134
0:6:42,840 --> 0:6:44,350
(LAUGHTER)

135
0:6:45,600 --> 0:6:49,190
Whatever happens, we can't
let Sissi tell her father.

136
0:6:49,190 --> 0:6:50,680
Don't worry, Jeremie.

137
0:6:50,680 --> 0:6:52,460
I've got an idea.

138
0:6:54,630 --> 0:6:56,920
I'm so happy that
you finally decided

139
0:6:56,920 --> 0:6:58,920
to give me a lesson
in Pen-sharve Key-lot.

140
0:6:58,920 --> 0:7:0,240
Pencak Silat.

141
0:7:0,240 --> 0:7:2,520
Whatever. Well, I wonder
what could've made you

142
0:7:2,520 --> 0:7:4,720
change your mind all of a sudden!

143
0:7:5,170 --> 0:7:6,200
Is it this one?

144
0:7:6,200 --> 0:7:7,400
Uh-huh.

145
0:7:13,230 --> 0:7:14,190
Huh?

146
0:7:14,920 --> 0:7:18,120
Maybe <i>this</i> is what you're looking for.

147
0:7:18,120 --> 0:7:20,140
This is a basic lanka.

148
0:7:20,140 --> 0:7:21,830
You ought to be able to manage it.

149
0:7:23,210 --> 0:7:24,120
(CHUCKLES)

150
0:7:24,120 --> 0:7:25,300
Huh?

151
0:7:26,120 --> 0:7:28,420
You were right, Sissi. As usual.

152
0:7:28,420 --> 0:7:30,20
They were after the minidisc!

153
0:7:30,20 --> 0:7:32,120
Oh, wow! Gentlemen,

154
0:7:32,120 --> 0:7:33,990
did you think you were
smarter than me?

155
0:7:33,990 --> 0:7:35,740
You don't know me very well.

156
0:7:35,740 --> 0:7:37,920
So, now it's time to spill the beans.

157
0:7:37,920 --> 0:7:40,470
Tell me everything you've been up to
for long as I can remember!

158
0:7:40,470 --> 0:7:42,510
What's the big conspiracy!

159
0:7:42,720 --> 0:7:46,50
Oh, you won't tell me a thing? Is that it?

160
0:7:47,240 --> 0:7:49,850
Okay, then. You asked for it.

161
0:7:49,850 --> 0:7:53,700
I'm gonna play this recording
for my father. Hmph.

162
0:8:5,940 --> 0:8:7,600
It's Tuesday already!

163
0:8:7,600 --> 0:8:8,720
No, you're not dreaming!

164
0:8:8,720 --> 0:8:10,680
Or, rather, you're
not dreaming anymore!

165
0:8:10,680 --> 0:8:14,10
It's already 7 o'clock in
the morning on <i>Sky Radio</i>.

166
0:8:14,10 --> 0:8:15,360
Look out your window!

167
0:8:15,360 --> 0:8:17,600
The sun is shining,
the birds are singing…

168
0:8:17,660 --> 0:8:19,200
…Thanks to <i>Sky Radio</i>

169
0:8:19,200 --> 0:8:21,90
with the Subsonics' latest hit!
Here it--

170
0:8:19,200 --> 0:8:21,90
Hi, dad.

171
0:8:21,90 --> 0:8:22,970
Yumi, I have to talk to you.

172
0:8:22,970 --> 0:8:24,680
Papa, I know what
you're gonna tell me.

173
0:8:24,680 --> 0:8:26,220
 You're totally right.

174
0:8:26,220 --> 0:8:27,510
Okay! I'm sorry!

175
0:8:28,230 --> 0:8:29,690
Yumi!

176
0:8:30,50 --> 0:8:31,680
But I didn't program
going back in time.

177
0:8:31,680 --> 0:8:34,420
Then how do you explain the fact
that Tuesday is starting again?

178
0:8:34,420 --> 0:8:35,740
It's weird.

179
0:8:35,740 --> 0:8:38,290
Let's go to over to the factory
after science class to check it out.

180
0:8:38,290 --> 0:8:40,940
At least we've got a second chance
to get Sissi off our backs.

181
0:8:41,360 --> 0:8:43,990
Sissi? Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

182
0:8:43,990 --> 0:8:46,920
What? You are?
B-But you see, I…

183
0:8:46,920 --> 0:8:48,700
I wanted to talk to Jeremie.

184
0:8:48,700 --> 0:8:49,740
Aw, that can wait.

185
0:8:49,740 --> 0:8:52,580
There's something I've been wanting
to ask you for a long time.

186
0:8:52,580 --> 0:8:55,250
But I just can't
bring myself to do it.

187
0:8:55,250 --> 0:8:58,840
You…uh…y-you can't…

188
0:8:58,840 --> 0:9:2,240
Would you like to learn
Penchak Silat with me?

189
0:9:2,240 --> 0:9:4,600
Well, uh, yes!

190
0:9:5,400 --> 0:9:6,990
So, would you be
kind enough to tell me

191
0:9:6,990 --> 0:9:9,830
the mass and moles
of two oxygen atoms?

192
0:9:9,830 --> 0:9:11,970
32 grams per mole, mam.

193
0:9:11,970 --> 0:9:14,480
Uh, oh. Yes, that's right.

194
0:9:14,480 --> 0:9:16,600
Uh, very well, Odd. Now, please,

195
0:9:16,600 --> 0:9:19,250
would you explain to me the
principle of photosynthesis?

196
0:9:19,250 --> 0:9:20,710
Of course, mam.

197
0:9:20,710 --> 0:9:22,420
That would be the synthesis of oxygen

198
0:9:22,420 --> 0:9:25,40
from plants possessing
chlorophyll placed in light.

199
0:9:25,40 --> 0:9:27,450
Odd, is it really you?

200
0:9:27,450 --> 0:9:29,260
You haven't been replaced by a clone?

201
0:9:29,260 --> 0:9:30,420
No, mam, why?

202
0:9:30,420 --> 0:9:31,490
Is something wrong?

203
0:9:31,490 --> 0:9:33,250
No…uh, no.

204
0:9:33,250 --> 0:9:34,940
Let's go on with our lesson.

205
0:9:34,940 --> 0:9:38,280
Wow. Hey, being a
good student is so cool!

206
0:9:38,280 --> 0:9:39,890
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

207
0:9:41,820 --> 0:9:44,240
Very good. You learn really fast.

208
0:9:44,240 --> 0:9:46,450
You think so? That's great!

209
0:9:46,450 --> 0:9:50,40
Uh, Sissi, could…could I
talk to you as a friend?

210
0:9:50,40 --> 0:9:52,320
Sorry? As a what?

211
0:9:52,320 --> 0:9:53,720
As a friend.

212
0:9:53,720 --> 0:9:56,880
You see…I'm worried
about Jeremie and Aelita.

213
0:9:56,880 --> 0:9:58,320
I know you're gonna laugh, but…

214
0:9:58,320 --> 0:9:59,930
Laugh? But why?

215
0:9:59,930 --> 0:10:1,340
Well, um…

216
0:10:1,340 --> 0:10:4,40
You see, they've kind of lost it.

217
0:10:4,40 --> 0:10:7,750
For some strange reason,
they think they're <i>virtual people</i>.

218
0:10:7,750 --> 0:10:8,930
What's that?

219
0:10:9,110 --> 0:10:10,930
Do you think we're going
to live the same day

220
0:10:10,930 --> 0:10:12,430
over and over again?

221
0:10:12,430 --> 0:10:15,390
First, I have to isolate the
program that jumps back in time

222
0:10:15,390 --> 0:10:16,710
to see what's going on.

223
0:10:16,710 --> 0:10:17,900
Maybe it's XANA's doing.

224
0:10:17,900 --> 0:10:19,300
We'll know in a minute.

225
0:10:19,300 --> 0:10:21,700
Odd, you mind telling us
what you're doing over there?

226
0:10:21,700 --> 0:10:22,680
I'm studying.

227
0:10:22,680 --> 0:10:24,890
That's what you wanted
me to do, wasn't it?

228
0:10:25,380 --> 0:10:26,700
Look at that!

229
0:10:27,230 --> 0:10:30,130
XANA's managed to take control
over going back in time!

230
0:10:30,130 --> 0:10:31,290
But how?

231
0:10:31,290 --> 0:10:34,550
In my opinion, by using the data
we recovered from sector five.

232
0:10:34,550 --> 0:10:36,510
Booby-trapped data!

233
0:10:38,200 --> 0:10:39,730
But why would he do that?

234
0:10:39,730 --> 0:10:41,100
He must have a good reason.

235
0:10:41,100 --> 0:10:41,880
I don't know.

236
0:10:41,880 --> 0:10:44,240
In any event,
it's starting up again.

237
0:10:45,960 --> 0:10:48,400
We're gonna go directly
back in time in a few minutes.

238
0:10:48,400 --> 0:10:51,130
I'm launching a scan to see
if a tower has been activated.

239
0:10:51,390 --> 0:10:53,890
<i>I can't believe that
soon I'll be really real.</i>

240
0:10:53,890 --> 0:10:55,790
It's even worse than I thought.

241
0:10:55,790 --> 0:10:57,560
They've gone right off the deep end.

242
0:10:57,560 --> 0:10:59,710
But…that's crazy.

243
0:10:59,710 --> 0:11:2,280
It's much worse.
They're totally out of it.

244
0:11:2,280 --> 0:11:4,700
Tower activated!
XANA's launched an attack!

245
0:11:4,700 --> 0:11:5,770
But what kind?

246
0:11:5,770 --> 0:11:8,150
I don't know yet, but
we can expect the worst.

247
0:11:8,150 --> 0:11:11,430
He didn't take control of
jumping back in time for the fun of it.

248
0:11:11,430 --> 0:11:14,240
Get ready! It's starting again!

249
0:11:18,490 --> 0:11:19,980
It's Tues--

250
0:11:20,650 --> 0:11:22,250
…with the Subsonics' latest hit--

251
0:11:22,810 --> 0:11:24,250
Hi, dad!

252
0:11:24,250 --> 0:11:25,300
Yumi!

253
0:11:25,300 --> 0:11:28,840
What's fascinating is that
plants use the sun's energy

254
0:11:28,840 --> 0:11:32,210
to change water and
carbon dioxide into glucose,

255
0:11:32,210 --> 0:11:34,880
and in exchange, give off oxygen!

256
0:11:34,880 --> 0:11:36,420
Odd, if you keep this up,

257
0:11:36,420 --> 0:11:38,440
you'll be teaching
the class instead of me.

258
0:11:38,440 --> 0:11:42,150
Oh, I certainly don't know
as much as you, Misses Hertz.

259
0:11:42,150 --> 0:11:43,570
I'm beginning to wonder.

260
0:11:43,570 --> 0:11:47,270
Just think. Now I'll have to
start all over again with Sissi.

261
0:11:47,270 --> 0:11:48,710
Don't even bother, Ulrich.

262
0:11:48,710 --> 0:11:52,80
I need you too much on Lyoko
to help the others deactivate the tower.

263
0:11:52,80 --> 0:11:53,600
But what about Sissi?

264
0:11:53,600 --> 0:11:54,730
We'll find another way.

265
0:11:54,730 --> 0:11:55,750
Fair enough.

266
0:11:55,750 --> 0:11:58,770
I really don't think I could be
as clever as yesterday.

267
0:11:58,770 --> 0:12:0,30
Not like Odd.

273
0:12:28,780 --> 0:12:30,760
Welcome to Lyoko, ladies.

274
0:12:30,760 --> 0:12:34,340
The activated tower is on
the second plateau to the north.

275
0:12:34,340 --> 0:12:36,600
Sorry, but you're gonna
have to go without vehicles

276
0:12:36,600 --> 0:12:39,140
because I don't have enough
machine resources to bring them up.

277
0:12:39,140 --> 0:12:41,900
<i>No sweat. It'll be
just like the good old days.</i>

278
0:12:41,900 --> 0:12:42,900
Come on. Let's go.

279
0:12:42,900 --> 0:12:43,760
<i>Good luck.</i>

280
0:12:43,760 --> 0:12:46,900
<i>I'm gonna try and regain
control of jumping back in time.</i>

281
0:12:49,240 --> 0:12:50,380
It's kind of quiet.

282
0:12:50,380 --> 0:12:52,180
Too quiet if you ask me.

283
0:12:52,180 --> 0:12:55,400
You can never really enjoy the
present moment, can you, Ulrich?

284

285
0:12:57,520 --> 0:12:59,700
Oh, yes I can.

286
0:13:2,700 --> 0:13:4,880
Jeremie, XANA is
sending us monsters.

287
0:13:4,880 --> 0:13:5,900
So I see.

288
0:13:5,900 --> 0:13:7,420
Separate their flight pattern.

289
0:13:7,420 --> 0:13:8,510
That ought to weaken them.

290
0:13:8,510 --> 0:13:10,820
Odd, take Aelita to the tower.

291
0:13:10,820 --> 0:13:13,210
Ulrich and I will take care
of the monsters.

292
0:13:13,610 --> 0:13:14,960
<i>Dive! On your right!</i>

293
0:13:14,960 --> 0:13:18,240
<i>It should be a path
that leads to the tower!</i>

294
0:13:18,990 --> 0:13:20,800
With a platform to land on?

295
0:13:20,800 --> 0:13:22,190
<i>Well, logically, yes.</i>

296
0:13:22,190 --> 0:13:23,860

Yes, it's, uh, strange, indeed.

0:17:45,50 --> 0:17:46,470
I need you over here.

0:17:46,470 --> 0:17:47,990
We’re waiting for Jeremie.

Without him, we can’t do anything.

<i>Leave your message.
I’ll call you back.</i>

0:17:51,280 --> 0:17:52,700
Still no answer.

353
0:17:52,700 --> 0:17:54,750
Okay. We'll find him.

354
0:17:56,890 --> 0:17:58,930
Sissi, you’re not yourself.

355
0:17:58,930 --> 0:18:0,370
XANA has possessed you.

356
0:18:0,370 --> 0:18:2,120
You must not obey him!

0:18:33,730 --> 0:18:34,750
Aelita?

Aelita!

0:18:37,210 --> 0:18:38,430
<i>Perfect!</i>

0:18:38,430 --> 0:18:40,800
<i>They’ll never think of
looking for him here.</i>

369
0:18:40,800 --> 0:18:42,470
But, Sissi, what’s going on?

370
0:18:42,470 --> 0:18:44,700
<i>You! Be quiet!</i>

371
0:18:48,410 --> 0:18:51,620

Absolutely nothing!

375
0:19:3,660 --> 0:19:5,640

get out of here!

Go on. I’ll handle her.

0:19:14,150 --> 0:19:15,430

Good luck.

383
0:19:30,380 --> 0:19:32,680
How did XANA learn to
possess people?

384
0:19:32,680 --> 0:19:34,730
It looks like he's
increased his powers.

385
0:19:34,730 --> 0:19:36,570
Brilliant, Einstein! But how!

386
0:19:36,570 --> 0:19:38,710
With…the jumps back in time!

387
0:19:38,710 --> 0:19:39,530
You think so?

388
0:19:39,530 --> 0:19:40,630
I sure do.

The super calculator
is a quantum computer

390
0:19:43,20 --> 0:19:44,980
that uses the properties of qubytes.

391
0:19:44,980 --> 0:19:48,800
Every time you add qubytes,
its power theoretically doubles.

392
0:19:49,260 --> 0:19:49,980
I think the po--

393
0:19:49,980 --> 0:19:52,110
Jeremie, do you mind
saying that in English?

394
0:19:52,110 --> 0:19:55,830
Well, the super calculator is so powerful
that it can undoubtedly do it.

395
0:20:11,930 --> 0:20:13,630
Oh, no! The Scyphozoa!

Yeah.

Anyway, we now know that
XANA can control people.

432
0:23:14,590 --> 0:23:18,20
We also know that jumping
back in time increases his power.

433
0:23:18,20 --> 0:23:19,990
We’re going to have to be very careful.

434
0:23:19,990 --> 0:23:22,410
The next round is gonna
be tougher than ever.
