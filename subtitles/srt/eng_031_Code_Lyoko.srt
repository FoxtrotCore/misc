but they didn’t succeed.

184
0:10:40,880 --> 0:10:42,390
Why would it work on Jeremie?

185
0:10:42,390 --> 0:10:44,880
<i>No idea, but I saw him
heading for the park lands.</i>

<i>Aelita’s in his arms.
She was unconscious.</i>

Oh, no.

188
0:10:52,260 --> 0:10:53,330
I’ll check the superscan.

189
0:10:53,330 --> 0:10:54,520
Let’s meet at the factory.

190
0:10:54,520 --> 0:10:55,480
Okay.

191
0:10:55,480 --> 0:10:56,130
Pitiful!

on you to raise the level!

Uh, okay!

195
0:11:2,520 --> 0:11:4,660
But I’ve gotta go to
the restroom first.

0:11:4,660 --> 0:11:6,70
Oh, and I gotta go too, Jim!

Okay, okay!

0:11:8,760 --> 0:11:10,130
Make it snappy!

200
0:11:11,190 --> 0:11:13,360
Right, which one of you wimps is next?

201
0:11:16,580 --> 0:11:18,40
Sector One. The ice territory.

202
0:11:18,40 --> 0:11:19,480
South-southeast.

203
0:11:19,780 --> 0:11:20,920
Huh?

204
0:11:27,890 --> 0:11:28,660
Yeah.

205
0:11:28,660 --> 0:11:29,860
XANA's attacked!

206
0:11:29,860 --> 0:11:31,490
We have to stop Jeremie, and fast, too.

207
0:11:31,490 --> 0:11:33,220
Okay. We’re on it!

208
0:11:39,840 --> 0:11:41,170
Jeremie!

209
0:11:45,440 --> 0:11:47,960
Jeremie, no! Listen to me, please!

210
0:12:9,120 --> 0:12:10,480
So, you going down, too?

211
0:12:18,760 --> 0:12:21,0
Boy, it’s totally weird to be
fighting against Jeremie.

Okay! Over here, twinkle fingers!

we’re really gonna hit it off!

I’m not as good as Jeremie at it.

He who runs well goes far!

Is Odd the one who
teaches you nonsense like that?

233
0:13:58,240 --> 0:14:0,780
No. As a matter of fact, it’s Jim!

Whoa!

0:14:7,700 --> 0:14:10,620
I’m sure glad that post was
there and not my face.

Uh-oh! That wasn’t
very smart, was it?

0:14:21,80 --> 0:14:23,930
Especially since you’re
the one who’s gotta fix it.

Keep your eyes open, huh.

241
0:14:28,620 --> 0:14:31,840
We don’t have Jeremie to
warn us about monsters this time.

Oh, easy does it!

Hah ha! Not so clever now, huh?

Scared of heights, huh?

O-Okay, so you’re not
scared of heights.

Nice one, Aelita!

Ugh.

0:21:41,400 --> 0:21:43,20
Strange.

285
0:21:43,460 --> 0:21:45,280
I remember talking to Odd and Ulrich,

286
0:21:45,280 --> 0:21:48,550
and then after that, nothing.
Just a black hole.

287
0:21:48,730 --> 0:21:50,640
XANA took control of you.

288
0:21:51,730 --> 0:21:54,840
He destroyed all of Franz Hopper’s CD’s.

289
0:21:54,840 --> 0:21:57,440
Apparently he had a problem with his notes.

290
0:21:57,440 --> 0:21:58,350
Whew.

291
0:21:58,350 --> 0:22:1,130
What do you mean, “whew?” It’s a disaster!

292
0:22:1,130 --> 0:22:2,310
No, it isn’t.

293
0:22:2,310 --> 0:22:4,440
Last night, when I got back
from the train station,

294
0:22:4,440 --> 0:22:6,440
I stopped in here and I copied the CD’s

295
0:22:6,440 --> 0:22:9,600
onto a highly restricted access
part of the supercomputer.

296
0:22:9,600 --> 0:22:11,620
I'm the only one who can access them.

You’re a genius, Jeremie!

298
0:22:13,420 --> 0:22:15,130
Still, there’s something I don’t get.

299
0:22:15,130 --> 0:22:17,600
Why couldn't XANA’s ghosts
take control of Odd and me

300
0:22:17,600 --> 0:22:19,570
and have no trouble controlling Jeremie?

0:22:19,570 --> 0:22:21,20
No idea.

302
0:22:21,20 --> 0:22:22,680
I might have an explanation.

303
0:22:22,680 --> 0:22:25,770
Apart from you, we’re all
used to fighting on Lyoko.

304
0:22:25,770 --> 0:22:28,860
Maybe that gives us
more resistance to XANA.

305
0:22:28,860 --> 0:22:30,310
Maybe.

306
0:22:30,310 --> 0:22:31,880
But then how can we protect me?

307
0:22:31,880 --> 0:22:33,280
Hmn.

308
0:22:33,280 --> 0:22:34,970
I just might have the answer.

That’s the last time
I ever set foot on Lyoko!

313
0:22:45,110 --> 0:22:45,930
Why?

314
0:22:45,930 --> 0:22:48,150
Just because of a couple of megatanks?

315
0:22:48,150 --> 0:22:50,80
It’s really just not my thing!

316
0:22:50,750 --> 0:22:52,310
I’ll never be able to hack it!

0:22:52,310 --> 0:22:55,400
You know, I think I’d <i>rather</i>
be possessed by XANA

0:22:55,400 --> 0:22:56,570
than go back there.

319
0:22:56,570 --> 0:22:59,350
I’ll keep on the lookout for ghosts, that's all.

Well?

0:23:0,510 --> 0:23:2,570
What did he look like on Lyoko?

0:23:2,570 --> 0:23:5,620
He looked…how--
how can I say this tactfully?
