YUMI: A-hm?


JEREMY: Yumi? It’s Jeremy.


We need you to come to the
factory right now!


The superscan has just picked up
an attack from Xana.


And this one looks like big trouble.


YUMI: Why?


JEREMY: Because believe it or not,
there are five activated towers.


JEREMIE: I’ve got a bad feeling about this one.


ODD: Relax Einstein, we’ll take care of
your five towers in no time.


YUMI: I got here as quickly as I could.


JEREMIE: Huh?


FRANZ: Ah, there you are.


I’ve been expecting you.


That Xana locks the door,
but leaves the window wide open.


JEREMIE: Bu- but I mean,
wh- what are you doing here?


FRANZ: I’m deactivating the towers.


JEREMIE: Without going to Lyoko?


FRANZ: Of course.


AELITA: But-ah, who are you?


FRANZ: What?


Haven’t you understood yet?


I’m Franz Hopper.


AELITA: Huh?


JEREMIE: Huh?


FRANZ: I’m the one who created Lyoko,
and Xana too.


But then I lost control of it.


In the very beginning it was a program
that I designed to counter a military project


based on a multi-agent system.


AELITA: Well, what about me?


FRANZ: Eh?


I created you to be the guardian of Lyoko.


But I never thought I’d see you
one day in flesh and blood.


ULRICH: But then, where have you
been for these last few years.


FRANZ: Well let’s say I was kind of prisoner,
who finally managed to escape.


YUMI: What now then?


FRANZ: We’ve got to destroy Xana
for once and for all.


JEREMIE: We’d love to,
but Xana’s given Aelita a bug.


If we switch the supercomputer off,
then Aelita switches off too.


FRANZ: We’ll find the anti-virus. You’ll see.


JEREMIE: Sure, but how?


FRANZ: Well, that young man is why I came.
I’m here to help.


AELITA: He’s very fatherly,
actually in a way he is my father.


He’s the one who created me.


JEREMIE: That’s true.


I adore my own dad,
but he’s sure no genius.


But this Franz Hopper is a real live genious.


AELITA: Yeah, that’s it for me.
I’m gonna go to bed.


JEREMIE: Okay, good night.


AELITA: Good night Jeremie.


MR. BELPOIS: Jeremie? It’s me.


JEREMIE: Franz?


MR. BELPOIS: No, Michael. Your father.
Do you know why I’m calling?


Happy birthday big guy.


JEREMIE: Huh?


DEFAULT: HAPPY BIRTHDAY EINSTEIN!


MR. BELPOIS: By the way,
your mother’s worried about you.


You should call us more often.


Now, have you thought about 
that school for gifted children?


Jeremie?


JEREMIE: Uh, yeah sure.
Ok dad, sure.


Eh, listen I have to go.
My friends just came in.


Talk to you soon!


ODD: Here, a present.


ULRICH: What are you waiting for,
go on, open it!


ODD: Teehee.


JEREMIE: Wow! It’s great!


ODD: Yeah! And I drew it from memory!


ULRICH: So you can imagine
how much effort it took.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)


JEREMIE: Thanks everyone!


Hey, how about going over
to the factory now?


I can’t wait to see Franz again.


FRANZ: You used the scanners to
virtualize human beings?


JEREMIE: Well, yes.


It’s the only way we could
find to deactivate towers on Lyoko.


FRANZ: The virtualization process
was not ready for that yet.


It’s a very dangerous procedure,
with serious side effects.


YUMI: Such as?


FRANZ: Cell degeneration.


Odd seems ok.


Ulrich too.


But Yumi…


JEREMIE: No! It can’t be!


YUMI: I can’t believe it!
What a nightmare.


ODD: Nice one Einstein,


Dr. Shrank transplants animal limbs
onto human beings,


but compared to you he’s small time.


JEREMIE: I… I couldn’t have known.


I’m sorry.


ULRICH: You’re sorry?


Well that’s not gonna help cure Yumi.


JEREMIE: Yumi, I…


YUMI: Leave me alone Jeremie…


I need to be by myself.


You coming Ulrich?


JEREMIE: I’m sure there is
a way to cure Yumi.


ODD: We don’t even know
exactly what’s wrong with her.


JEREMIE: I’ll work it out.
I promise I will.


ULRICH: I think you’ve done
enough damage as it is.


JEREMIE: What do you mean by that?!


That everything’s been my
fault right from the start?!


ULRICH: You’re the brains in this
outfit, Einstein.


AELITA: You know Ulrich,
if it weren’t for the scanners,


I wouldn’t be here.


MS. ISHIYAMA: Yumi?
Are you okay?


YUMI: I’m not very hungry tonight.


HIROKI: -laughter- Ohh Ulrich, I looove you. -laughter-


MS. ISHIYAMA: Hiroki…


YUMI: I’m going to bed.


MS. ISHIYAMA: That’s it then.
We’re in the thick of it now.


MR. ISHIYAMA: Of what?


MS. ISHIYAMA: A teenage crisis.


YUMI: Hello?


FRANZ: Yumi? It’s Franz.


I have some good news.


Tell the others and meet me
first thing tomorrow at the Factory.


YUMI: Okay, we’ll be there.


FRANZ: I now know how to program
the anti-virus which will free Aelita.


All I need now is the data from Sector 5.


AELITA: Great! We’ll go and get it then.


JEREMIE: I thought the scanners
were too dangerous to use.


FRANZ: If we wanna to get to Sector 5,
then we have no choice.


ODD: It’ll be our final mission.


JEREMIE: Okay, then what am I supposed to do?


FRANZ: If I were you,
I’d stay out of the way.


JEREMIE: It’s not fair!


Everyone blames me for everything,


and after all we all turned on
the supercomputer back on together.


FRANZ: Perhaps, but you were the one
who played sorcerer’s apprentice.


You’re the one who put your
friends lives at risk.
And you’re the one who let
Xana destroy my diary.


JEREMIE: Fine, I get it.


AELITA: Jeremie!


FRANZ: Right, shall we?


MR. BELPOIS: Hello?


JEREMIE: Dad, it’s me.


MR. BELPOIS: Jeremie?


JEREMIE: You know that school for gifted children,
that you were talking about?


MR. BELPOIS: Yes?


JEREMIE: I wanna go.
Can you come and get me?


MR. BELPOIS: When?


JEREMIE: As soon as possible.


MR. BELPOIS: Okay, I’ll be there tomorrow.


JEREMIE: Oh, right. Alright then.


FRANZ: Transfer Ulrich.


Transfer Yumi.


Transfer Odd.


Scanner Yumi.


Scanner Ulrich.


Scanner Odd.


Virtualization.


ULRICH: Hey! We’ve arrived directly in Sector 5!


FRANZ: Of course.


There is a direct access.
The transporter’s a bit outdated.


ODD: Cool!


FRANZ: And you’re the one who let
Xana destroy my diary…


JEREMIE: Franz Hopper’s diary…


But how could he know,
that diary was destroyed?


YUMI: Maybe you’ll find out more about
the mysterious owner of the Hermitage.


JEREMIE: Everything’s encrypted,
I have to decode it.


FRANZ: And you’re the one who let
Xana destroy my diary…


JEREMIE: Huh? How could Franz Hopper know that?!


AELITA: Xana took control of you.


JEREMIE: He destroyed all of Franz Hopper’s Cds.


Apparently had a problem with those notes.


FRANZ: And you’re the one who let
Xana destroy my diary…


JEREMIE: Xana.


FRANZ: The countdown has begun.
Clean up, and I’ll send Aelita over.


YUMI: Alright.


ODD: Franz? I don’t mind cleaning up,
but we’re gonna need some industrial strength detergent.


FRANZ: No problem, I’ve programmed each some new weapons!


ODD: Uhh, I don’t see what’s new about this…


ODD: Woo-hoo! Homing darts!


ULRICH: There’s the key! Leave it to me.


YUMI: Ulrich, how are you doing?


ULRICH: It’s a done deal.


FRANZ: Well done Ulrich.


YUMI: Alrighty.


ODD: It’s almost too easy.
I want more Creepers.


FRANZ: Don’t worry Odd.
It’s not over yet.


I’ve got more surprises in store for you.


Aelita, are you ready for virtualization?


AELITA: Yes.


JEREMIE: Sssh!


AELITA: Huh?


FRANZ: Here we go.


Transfer Aelita.


Scanner.


Virtualization.


AELITA: Yumi?
Ulrich?


Odd?


Franz, I’m not in Sector 5.
What’s going on?


FRANZ: Everything’s under control.


Jeremie, what are you doing here?


JEREMIE: I just came to see
how you’re managing, Xana.


FRANZ: You’re very clever Jeremie,
but you’re too late.


ODD: Hey, wanna make this a contest?
Whoever get’s the most, wins!


YUMI: What’s going on? Franz?!


ODD: Something’s wrong!


Let’s get out of here.


YUMI: I get the feeling we’ve been double crossed.


ODD: Bye!


FRANZ: Now your friends are in a little trouble.


I’ve fixed things so that they can never rematerialize.


No more life-points and it’s bye-bye!


And now, for the grand finale.


ULRICH: What now?


ODD: Well, there’s only one thing to do.


Franz! We need help!


YUMI: No! Not Franz, Xana!


ODD: This must be the surprise…


JEREMIE: Huh?


ODD: Hellooo? You had enough?


Ciao!


FRANZ: Admit you’re defeated Jeremie.


JEREMIE: No. Not this time.


FRANZ: Hm?


What’s the meaning of this?!


JEREMIE: A decoy.


FRANZ: Huh? Noooooo!


JEREMIE: Wow!


YUMI: I’ve often wondered how this would all end.
Now I know, this is it.


No! Ulrich!


ODD: It can’t be!


JEREMIE: C’mon! Don’t be so pessimistic Odd.


YUMI: Jeremie?


JEREMIE: Yes, I’m back.
Come on, let’s start over.


ODD: Nothing like my trusty old gear.


YUMI: What about Ulrich?


JEREMIE: All’s well, I managed to
reprogram the materialization just in time.


He’s home.
Ready Aelita?


AELITA: Yes Jeremie.


JEREMIE: All we gotta do now,
is to deactivate the tower.


I’m sending you Aelita.
Virtualization.


Aelita, I’m entering the code SCIPIO.


ULRICH: Jeremie?!


What’s going on?
What can I do?


AELITA: Jeremie,
I’m in the core zone.


ULRICH: Aelita?


Deactivate the tower, hurry up!


AELITA: Hurry!


Jeremie’s in trouble.


ULRICH: Jeremie!


ODD: Aelita!


ULRICH: Hang in there, please!


AELITA: Tower deactivated.


ULRICH: Don’t worry buddy, everything’s okay now.


JEREMIE: Of course I’m not angry with you.


What’s more, I checked out your bio-schematic
during your rematerialization phase.


There’s no sign of alteration whatsoever.


YUMI: Oh, what a relief!


He really had me scared, that Franz Hopper.


JEREMIE: That false Franz Hopper.


The real one is still somewhere on Lyoko.


ODD: Huh?


JEREMIE: Dad?!


MR. BELPOIS: Are you ready son? Let’s go.


JEREMIE: Wait, things have changed.


Lemme explain.


MR. BELPOIS: You sure you’ve thought it over?


JEREMIE: Yes.


I’m really sorry I made you come
all the way out here for nothing.


MR. BELPOIS: Don’t you worry about it.


And don’t forget to give us a call from time to time.


JEREMIE: I promise.


ODD: Hey, what’s going on here?
Where were you going?


JEREMIE: Nowhere.


AELITA: Your father seems like a really nice guy.


JEREMIE: Yeah, I love him.


He’s great.


ULRICH: Like father like son.
