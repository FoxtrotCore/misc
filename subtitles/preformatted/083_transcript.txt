83 - Hard Luck


ULRICH: (GASPS)


ODD: (GRUNTING)


ULRICH: Uh, hey, Odd, if you’re trying to clean up the room,
you better find another system.


ODD: There, that’s what I was looking for. Oh, no it’s not.


I don’t want to be late for breakfast.


ULRICH: So you can steal an extra croissant?


ODD: Well yeah, but also to steal Azra’s heart.


(GRUNTS) Where are my shoes?


ULRICH: Uh, you just have to follow the stink.


ODD: Hm.


ULRICH: You’re pretty wound up today.
You sure this morning is the best time?


ODD: Oh yeah, she borrowed my pencil sharpener yesterday.


ULRICH: And?


ODD: Well that’s a sure sign
that she’s totally crazy about me. So today’s the day.


Oh.


Oh, sorry about that.


ULRICH: I’m sorry for you, that means seven years bad luck.


ODD: Ulrich, are you superstitious?


ULRICH: Well yeah, aren’t you?


ODD: Are you kidding? No, not a chance.


Get real, good buddy. Four leaf clovers, rabbits feet,
horse shoes, are for old ladies. (SIGHS)


In fact, I can feel, today’s gonna be my lucky day.


JIM: Della Robbia! I’ll be you think it’s really funny
filling my shoes with cottage cheese, huh?


You just earned yourself eight hours of detention!


ODD: But it wasn’t me, Jim.


JIM: Well if it wasn’t you, then who was it?


ODD: Well, I’m not a snitch, Jim,
but you might want to check out Nicholas and Herb.


JIM: Thanks for the tip.


That’s gonna cost you four hours of detention
for selling out your classmates.


ODD: Can you believe that?


ULRICH: I told you, Odd, seven years bad luck.


ODD: Forget it, there’s no such thing as bad luck.


ROSA: Sorry, Odd, but I guess you’re out of luck.


ODD: Not even one croissant left, Rosa?
What am I supposed to eat?


ROSA: How about some dry toast?


ODD: No way.
Okay, gimme some hot chocolate to drown my sorrows in.


ROSA: I can’t do that, Odd, the machine is on the blink.


Never happened before in all the years
I’ve been working here.


ODD: (SIGHS)


YUMI: Tea and dry toast, Odd? What are you, sick?


ODD: No, not yet, but after I choke this down, I will be.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


JEREMIE: Okay everyone, here’s the plan.


You’ve got to return to the military base and destroy Xana’s supercomputer once and for all.


I don’t think it should be too complicated. That is
as long as Xana doesn’t have anything new up his sleeve.


ODD: Hm, Azra!


AZRA: Hm?


ODD: Let’s have breakfast together.


AZRA: So you can start drinking hot chocolate
through your nose again?


ODD: Uh, no, and besides, the machine is busted.


What I meant is, uh, I want to learn to speak Turkish.
Maybe you could give me lessons.


AZRA: Do you mean it?


ODD: Sure I do.


AZRA: Well, uh… we can discuss it.


ODD: Great idea, Azra, I can’t wait to start.


HERB: Hey, why did you tell Jim on me? You’re a snitch, Odd.


NICHOLAS: Not only that, but it was your idea to put cottage cheese
in his sneakers, which was incredibly funny. (LAUGHS)


HERB: Yeah, Odd, you just wait, we’re gonna get even with you
for that someday, you’ll see, you traitor.


ODD: Hm?


AZRA: I don’t blame Herb. Budala.


ODD: Bru-haha?


JEREMIE: Dork, that’s the word for numbskull[ab]. (LAUGHS)
Well, Odd, I guess you just had your first Turkish lesson.


ODD: (SIGHS)


ULRICH: {\i1}Walking under a ladder is like asking for bad luck.


YUMI: In Japan, people avoid anything to do with the number four,
because it sounds just like the word for death.


AELITA: Did you know that the word rabbit is bad luck for sailors?
So is spilling salt when you’re on a ship.


ODD: And I tell you that the only thing
that’ll bring you bad luck


is talking to an Odd about dumb superstition
because all you’ll get is being laughed at.


ULRICH: You think you’re smart, but I’ll bet by the end
of the day you’ll be crossing streets to avoid black cats.


JEREMIE: Okay, Odd and Yumi, you guys ready for teleportation?


ODD: {\i1}Ready.


YUMI: {\i1}Ready.


JEREMIE: Then here we go. Energize Yumi.


Energize Odd.


ODD: Well, go on.


YUMI: Huh?


Hey, Jeremie, we’ve got a slight problem. Where’s Odd?


JEREMIE: He’s still in his NavSkid.


ODD: {\i1}I don’t get it. What did I do wrong?


JEREMIE: I don’t get it either.
The teleportation failed for the first time.


ULRICH: I guess it’s bad luck.


ODD: Ulrich, save your dumb jokes or you’ll have the bad luck
of being forced to eat ten pounds of dry toast.


{\i1}What do we do now, Jeremie? Do you want me to go?


JEREMIE: No, you’ve got plenty to do dealing with the Replika.


The superscan has just picked up an activated tower.
I’ll send Ulrich.


ULRICH: {\i1}Just say when.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Energize Ulrich.


YUMI: Hey, Ulrich.


Where’s Odd?


ULRICH: Stuck on Lyoko. Disappointed?


YUMI: No, I’m glad in fact, he’s really bad luck today.


Ready?


ULRICH: Ready.


JEREMIE: Watch your step. If a tower’s been activated,
you can be sure that Xana’s planning to counter-attack.


AELITA: How about giving us the coordinates
so that we can go and deactivate it?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Due west from your present position.


ODD: Let’s go!


ULRICH: As deserted as ever, huh?


YUMI: That’s good news.


AELITA: {\i1}Here we go.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Here are your vehicles.


ODD: Hm?


Jeremie, isn’t Aelita getting on the overboard with me?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Uh, you know, Odd{\i0}, uh, seeing how your day’s{\i1} been going
up to now, I’d rather you guys traveled separately.{\i0}


ODD: You all are such lame-os, I tell you everything’s cool!
(STUTTERING)


AELITA: Did you see that, Jeremie? What’s going on?


ODD: Hmph.


JEREMIE: I have no idea. I’ll check it out. You guys get going.


ULRICH: Freight elevator over there. It’ll take us downstairs.


By the way, Yumi, I never asked you this.
Which monsters do you like fighting the least of all?


YUMI: The Kankrelats.
I really hate fighting against big bugs. (GAGS)


ULRICH: Yeah, right. What I hate most are the Megatanks.
How about the-


YUMI: The Kankrelats.


ULRICH: Yeah, I know, you said that already.


YUMI: No, I mean over there! Kankrelats!


ULRICH: (GASPS)


YUMI: Hurry up!


(SIGHS) I wish Xana’d sent us a few Krabs.


ULRICH: I’d have prefered hornets.


Jeremie, do you read us?


JEREMIE: Loud and clear. Anything wrong?


ULRICH: {\i1}Yeah, we just found out why Xana activated a tower.
He’s teleporting Kankrelats our way.


JEREMIE: I’m on it. Aelita, Yumi and Ulrich have some visitors
at the base. {\i1}You have to deactivate the tower fast.{\i0}


AELITA: We’re on our way. I can see a canyon in the distance.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Gotcha. I’ll check the area and see if the tower is there.


SFX: (COMPUTER BEEPING)


JEREMIE: The tower is in the center of the canyon. Hurry up!


ODD: Okay. You see that, everything’s cool.
Superstition is for lame-os. I told- (SCREAMS)


AELITA: (GASPS)


Uh, you were saying?


ODD: Oh, okay.


Watch this.


Laser arrow!


Piece of cake.


ULRICH: The coast is clear in front of us.


YUMI: (GASPS) But not in back of us, look!


Nice one, Ulrich.


Let’s try to buy some time.


ULRICH: Good idea.


Jeremie…


JEREMIE: {\i1}What is it?


ULRICH: Any news? It’s getting rough here.


JEREMIE: Hang in there, Aelita and Odd are almost at the tower.


AELITA: Let’s do our thing.


ODD: Here we go.


AELITA: Energy field!


ODD: Laser arrow!


Who said I was jinxed?


But, but…


(SCREAMS)


AELITA: Odd, Odd, are you okay?


JEREMIE: Odd, what’s happening?
You lost half your life points just now.


AELITA: {\i1}It’s that stupid bug again, Jeremie.


ODD: What’s going on?


(SCREAMS)


AELITA: No!


Energy field!


That’ll teach you to zap my friend down.


Jeremie, I’m heading for the activated tower.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Okay, Aelita, make it fast.{\i0}
Yumi and Ulrich have got a huge, huge bug problem.


AELITA: {\i1}And what about the program bug,
do you know what’s causing it?


JEREMIE: No, not yet. {\i1}It might be a virus, or some made-in-Xana thing,
whatever it is, we’re not having any luck with it.{\i0}


ODD: There’s no such thing as luck, you got that!?!


YUMI: What kind of a place is this?


ULRICH: That’s exactly what I said the first time we came here.


YUMI: It looks like some sort of factory assembly line.


ULRICH: Yeah, but what do they assemble here?


YUMI: We might find that out in here.
It looks like a control terminal.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Check it out, Yumi.
Any info on Xana’s tactics can come in handy.


SFX: (COMPUTER BEEPS)


ULRICH: What’s going on with the tower, Jeremie?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita should be deactivating any minute now.


AELITA: You’re not gonna get off that easily, my friend.


(GASPS)


(GASPS)


Guess I’ve gotta go the rest of the way on foot.


Jeremie!


JEREMIE: {\i1}Yes, Aelita,{\i0} I saw it.


The bug seems to be having an effect on you too.
Better deactivate the tower fast before you disappear.


AELITA: {\i1}I’m going as fast as I can.


JEREMIE: Ulrich.


ULRICH: Yeah I read you.


JEREMIE: Aelita can’t deactivate the tower just yet.
She’s been affected by Odd’s bug too.


ODD: Hey, it’s not my bug, okay?


JEREMIE: Just my name for it until we figure out
exactly what’s going on.


ODD: It better be, because I’ve got nothing to do
with this mess, you hear? It’s just a question of chance.


ULRICH: Did you say chance? What do you know,
you’re not becoming superstitious are you?


YUMI: I figured it out.


ULRICH: Hm? Well?


YUMI: I think it’s an assembly line for motherboards
and electronic implants.


ULRICH: Electronic implants, but for what?


YUMI: To control those spiders for example.


ULRICH: Do you mean those cybernetic creatures in the jungle lab?


YUMI: Exactly what I mean.


ULRICH: Hm, makes sense. But the big question is
what Xana’s planning to do with all of them.


YUMI: I wish I knew the answer.


ULRICH: Huh?


ULRICH: (GRUNTS)


Impact!


Guess you’re just like Odd, not your lucky day.


YUMI: Thank you.


ULRICH: Any time.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Ulrich, Yumi, I just located the supercalculator.
Head for the southernmost end of the room.


ULRICH: Okay, we’re on our way.


{\i1}What about your end, what’s the latest?


JEREMIE: Pretty bad news, William just showed up on the Replika.


And if you ask me, it’s not just a friendly visit.


ULRICH: Jeremie, we’re coming to the supercalculator room.


Down there.


JEREMIE: {\i1}The supercalculator will have to wait.
First we’ve got to solve the William problem.


ULRICH: I’d love to. Got any suggestions?


JEREMIE: {\i1}We haven’t any choice. One of you has to be teleported
back to keep him from deactivating the Skid tower.


ULRICH: Okay.


What do we do, Yumi? You want me to go, or you?


YUMI: We can always play for it.


ULRICH: Hm?


DEFAULT: Paper, scissors, rock…


ULRICH: Scissors cut paper, don’t they?


YUMI: (SIGHS)


Get ready William. We’re good, Jeremie.
I’m the one who’s going.


JEREMIE: De-energize Yumi.


YUMI: Good luck.


ULRICH: You too.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Yumi, wake up! William’s coming!


YUMI: Yeah, I know, William, and I’m glad to see you, too.


ULRICH: Oh, wow.


Jeremie, the supercalculator’s infested with Kankrelats
over here. What’s holding Aelita up?


JEREMIE: She’s just about ready to enter the tower.


AELITA: Jeremie, I finally got here.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Great, don’t waste any time.


AELITA: (GASPS) Jeremie?


JEREMIE: I don’t believe this!


Ulrich, Aelita just got devirtualized. It looks like
{\i1}you’re on your own with the Kankrelats.{\i0}


ULRICH: Look, I know I’m good,
but there are seven of these creeps.


I could go down on this,
and that’ll blow the whole mission.


JEREMIE: Try to hold out until Yumi’s finished her combat.


If she beats William
she can come back and give you some help.


ULRICH: {\i1}Roger.


JEREMIE: That was great, Yumi! Get ready for another teleportation.
Ulrich needs your help.


YUMI: Okay- oh, no, hold on. I’m all bugged up.


Too late!


JEREMIE: Can’t believe how jinxed we are today.


YUMI: What is this dumb bug anyhow?


JEREMIE: That’s exactly what I’m about to find out.


It’s a Mandelbug.


ODD: A what?


JEREMIE: A bug in the virtualization software, and the causes
are so complex that its behavior seems totally chaotic.


And with no way to tell if the behavior is really chaotic
or just seems to be…


It’s impossible to differentiate it from
a Bohrbug or a Heisenbug[ac].


AELITA: Huh?


ODD: Couldn’t be any more clear.


JEREMIE: You mean it?


ODD: No.


AELITA: It’s an extremely unusual problem
and Jeremie doesn’t know how to fix it yet.


ODD: Oh, why didn’t you say so?


JEREMIE: Oh great, that’s all we needed now.


Ulrich, {\i1}I bet you want some good news.{\i0}


ULRICH: Yeah.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Uh, sorry, don’t have any. To make a long story short,
you’re still on your own, the tower’s still activated,


{\i1}and you’re probably gonna get the bug I can’t fix.


ULRICH: Is that all?


JEREMIE: {\i1}No, you’ve gotta work fast because Xana also sent in some
Tarantulas to blow up the Skid.


ULRICH: Great.


Ready to rumble, guys? Here we go!


ODD: Hey, did you see that?
Ulrich just knocked off three of them!


JEREMIE: But how did he do that? He’s only got two sabres!


AELITA: Incredible, there goes another one!


YUMI: He’s on a lucky streak today.


ODD: (SIGHS)


ULRICH: That’s that.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Nice going. Now get rid of the supercomputer.


{\i1}Better hurry, you’re fading fast!


ULRICH: (GRUNTING)


JEREMIE: The Replika’s disappearing too.


AELITA: What about the Skid?


JEREMIE: Hey, no sweat, I made a little remote control
piloting program for emergencies just like this one.


JEREMIE: Another Replika bites the dust, fantastic.


ULRICH: Who’s the man today, guys, huh?


Well, what do you think?


ODD: Luck, buddy, that’s what I think.


ULRICH: I knew you’d say that.


AELITA: (LAUGHS)


ODD: (SCREAMS)


ULRICH: What’d you do now?


ODD: What does it look like, I slipped.


I guess I can’t deny it.
Ever since I broke that mirror, I’ve been jinxed.


AELITA: Relax, Odd, jinxes don’t exist.
Luck does, but it changes.


ULRICH: Yeah, the only question is when.


ODD: Hm.


Ha ha! Lady luck might be smiling at me already.


Tada! Azra’s mobile.
Look, she left it behind on purpose just so I would find it.


ULRICH: Are you sure?


ODD: Sure I am. Now I’ve just got to wait for her
to call me to get it back.


SFX: (RINGING)


ODD: Hm?


I’d like to get my cell phone back.
Meet me under the arches right away.


See you guys later! I’ve got a date with cupid!


ULRICH: Great, tell cupid we said hi.


JEREMIE: Good luck!


ODD: It’s already good! So long!


ODD: (WHISTLES)


DEFAULT: (WHISTLES)


ODD: Azra?


JIM: No, it’s Jim Morales.


ODD: Huh? Oh, sorry, Jim, but you see,
I’m waiting to meet somebody, so if you don’t mind-


JIM: It was you who found my cell phone.


ODD: Hm?


Uh, you mean it’s yours?


JIM: Yeah, that’s right, why?


ODD: Because, I mean- I mean it’s not your style.


JIM: I like pink, got a problem with that?
Look at the color that you wear all the time.


ODD: Yeah, but pink with sparkles and a heart charm on it?
Isn’t that a bit too much?


JIM: Probably.


But I’d rather not talk about it.
