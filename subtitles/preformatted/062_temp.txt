MS. HERTZ: Right, quiet down please. Across the board
the results of the last class test were far from brilliant.


Your grades were almost all C’s and D’s.
Obviously as always there are exceptions.


Belpois, I gave you an A-.
The minus was a reminder that there’s no such thing as perfection.


Stern, you are clearly pushing the limits of your ”I don’t care” -attitude.
A nucleus is not made of croutons but protons, D-.


If memory serves, and mine is more reliable than yours,
you promised you’d but an honest effort, didn’t you?


Whereas it seems quite clear to me that you didn’t even glance at your notes.


This is not going to help you at the academic review tomorrow morning.


Poliakoff, zero.


A kilogram of Mercury doesn’t weigh a ton,
so if I were you, I’d stop snickering like an idiot.


ODD: Don’t worry, it’ll work out fine.


ULRICH: Doubt it, Hertz is gonna do everything she can to have me
transferred to ninth grade remedial.


YUMI: They wouldn’t do that in the middle of a year.


ULRICH: With my written grades, don’t bet on it.


My parents are gonna kill me 
and finding time to fight XANA is gonna be a real nightmare.


AELITA: Come on Ulrich, nothing’s been decided yet.


JEREMIE: She’s right, maybe a teacher will defend you.


Anyway, speaking of transfers, I’ve got some good news!
I finally found a way to virtualize you directly to Sector Five, don’t bad huh?


ODD: You mean without going through the transporter?


JEREMIE: Yeah, that’s right. By interpolating the source codes and Planck’s quantum space,
we can go around the Heisenberg Uncertainty Theory.


The only risk is coming up with a mathematical singularity.


ODD: In English?


JEREMIE: It can work, but it’s dangerous.
Before I can really be sure, I’m gonna need a…


ODD: Guinea pig?


JEREMIE: Right. Any volunteers?


ODD: The shortest stringbean, is it.


ULRICH: I guess today is not my day.


JEREMIE: We’ll run the test tonight at eight o’clock, okay?


ULRICH: Here, I’m leaving you my cherry soda
in case I don’t make it back.


ODD: You’re kidding! Thanks, but I couldn’t possibly accept.


Here Yumi, you’re the most worthy air to the great Ulrich,
the first man to set foot on Sector Five without passing Go.


JEREMIE: Tell me guys, did you all get to the arena?


ODD: Yup! Last stop, everybody out.


YUMI: We’re good Jeremie, we’re standing by to welcome Ulrich.


JEREMIE: Loud and clear Yumi.
Ulrich, you ready?


ULRICH: Roger.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Logically, you should arrive directly into Sector Five.
Right between Odd and Yumi.


ULRICH: Jeremie, you sure you know what you’re doing there?


JEREMIE: Yes! Well, about 98%.


{\i1}Hold on, Ulrich’s gonna be with you soon.
Transfer Ulrich.


{\i1}Scanner Ulrich.


Virtualization.


ODD: Where is he? Did he take a local instead of the express?


JEREMIE: The virtualization did take place, he should’ve appeared next to you.


AELITA: {\i1}Maybe he was transferred to the wrong place.


JEREMIE: I’ll do a search, but I can’t see how.


Oh no! {\i1}Impossible!{\i0}


YUMI: What? What’s the matter?


JEREMIE: {\i1}He- he doesn’t even show up on the screens anymore.


AELITA: You want us the sweep Sector Five to see if we can spot him?


JEREMIE: {\i1}And have XANA take advantage of the situation and pull a dirty one on us?
No thanks, I’ll run a search from here.


{\i1}You better come back in, I’ll rematerialize you now.


JEREMIE: Nothing in the Mountain sector, nothing in the arena,
nothing in the Celestial Dome, nothing in the Core of Lyoko,


and not a trace in Sector Five either.


YUMI: What are you saying?


JEREMIE: Ulrich has, disappeared.
I don’t know what to do.


I don’t get this, in spite all of my research,
I haven’t managed to localize him.


I’ll still keep searching from my room computer,
he’s gotta be somewhere.


YUMI: Go on, you can keep trying.
But the truth is you messed up big time and Ulrich might be lost forever!


ODD: You get off of there!


Oh Kiwi buddy, I’m sorry.


ULRICH: Jeremie?
Nice, thank you for such a warm welcome.


My hand, what’s going on?


Jeremie, what’s happening to me?


JEREMIE: Come in!


ULRICH: Yo Jeremie!


Odd, you can hear me right?


AELITA: Well, anything new?


JEREMIE: Nothing, still no sign of Ulrich.


ODD: C’mon, he couldn’t just disappear into thin air!


ULRICH: What do I have to do to make you see me?


JEREMIE: I must have made a mistake somewhere.
But for now, I don’t know where I could’ve messed up.


ULRICH: Yo-hoo? Yoho, Odd!
Ah, finally someone who can see me!


ODD: Kiwi, will you cut that out?


ULRICH: Yeah, you’re a good dog.
You got any ideas how to get them realise I’m here?


AELITA: Maybe emergent property appeared in the algorithms
and all through the normal functioning of a virtualization. It’s possible.


ULRICH: Looks more like a big system bug to me.
I’m down here. Lower.


Surprise!


ODD: That’s fantastic, all of my training methods have finally paid off!
Kiwi’s talking!


ULRICH: No no, it’s me talking, Ulrich from inside Kiwi’s body.


ODD: But what are you doing inside my dog? That’s crazy.


ULRICH: I entered Kiwi’s body by accident. It’s thanks to him that I can talk to you.
Otherwise I was just like some kind of disembodied ghost.


ODD: What a adorable little diggidy-dog.


ULRICH: Knock it off or I’ll bite you.


ODD: Oh, you mangy mutt!


JEREMIE: I think I know what happened.
During the virtualization Ulrich’s body and mind got separated.


AELITA: Is that the reason why you couldn’t localize him on Lyoko?


JEREMIE: Right, because it’s not Ulrich who’s there, it’s just his inanimate body,
his corporal envelope which doesn’t give the same signal.


ULRICH: Think you can put me back together?


JEREMIE: Since we have no classes today,
I’ll go back to the computer lab with Aelita and run another search.


Once we locate your body, I’m sure we can find a way to put you back into it, okay?


ULRICH: Great, and how long will that take you?


JEREMIE: I hope I have it all worked out this afternoon.


ULRICH: Cool, that gives me time to see about my future.


ODD: Hey, what are you talking about?


KIWI: (BARKING)


ODD: Ulrich, you still there?


YUMI: Yes Jeremie?


Alive? That’s great! Where did you find him?


Huh? Kiwi?


JIM: Hey.


Heya, who’s that handsome looking guy?
It’s Jim Morales.


ULRICH: Who’s that handsome looking guy?


Who’s that handsome looking guy?


Who’s that handsome looking guy?


NICHOLAS: Hey, thank you for finding it for me.
I’ve been looking for it everywhere.


ULRICH: Oh my back, ohh…


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)
Hello?


Mrs. Hertz, just the person I in fact I was hoping to talk to you about the academic review-


MS. HERTZ: Really Jim, call me Susanne.


{\i1}Actually, I have a favor to ask of you.
Meet me in the gym in five minutes.


ULRICH: Okay, I’ll be there Ms-uh-Susanne.


JEREMIE: Where can he be?


MS. HERTZ: Jim darling!
You once told me you used to be a professional ballroom dancer in Buenos Aires, right?


ULRICH: Yeah, that’s right.


MS. HERTZ: Good, then I’m going to need your help.
Ever since you mentioned that I’ve been absolutely dying to learn how to tango.


ULRICH: Well, uh, Just a minute Susanne,
first I wanted to discuss the case of Ulrich Stern.


MS. HERTZ: Oh no, no. Please, Jim, not now.
The academic review is the right time to deal with him.


ULRICH: But that’s what I mean. It’ll be too late then we need to discuss this now.


MS. HERTZ: Oh don’t be like that Jim,


I’ve got a date with Pedro for this Sunday afternoon dance and brunch,
and I got to learn how to dance the tango by then. 


If I don’t, he won’t pay any attention to me.


ULRICH: Okay but first, let’s talk about Stern.
If he had a second chance, he could get better, I think.


MS. HERTZ: I must have given that boy a thousand chances,
honestly I’m sicking tired of that good-for-nothing.


Come on now Jim, let’s tango!


JIM: Uh-uh, no second chance for Ulrich,
no Australian tango lessons.


I am out of here.


MS. HERTZ: Argentine tango!


SFX: (LAUGHTER)


ULRICH: Quiet down! Sounds like a zoo around here.


ODD: Fire away!


ULRICH: Odd, cut it out, it’s me Ulrich!


YUMI: Ulrich?


What are you doing inside Jim?


ULRICH: Trying to smooth things out with Mrs. Hertz,
but up to now no luck.


SFX:(PHONE RINGING)
YUMI: Hello? Yes Jeremie?


JEREMIE: We finally located Ulrich’s body. It turned up in Sector Five.


YUMI: Okay great, I’ll tell him.
You have to get to the Factory, looks like Jeremie’s solved your problem.


ULRICH: Okay, after the academic review.


It’s too important,
especially after what just happened with Mrs. Hertz.


YUMI: What happened?


ULRICH: I’d rather not talk about it.


I’ll be over there as soon as I can.


MR. DELMAS: Odd Della Robbia, it’s time for your classes academic review.
You are the class representative.


ODD: Oh no!


MR. DELMAS: Now hurry up!


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


JEREMIE: Yumi, something is wrong.
Ulrich’s body seems to be moving on it’s own.


YUMI: But isn’t that normal?


JEREMIE: Of course not, without Ulrich’s brain he shouldn’t do anything.
Better get over here as soon as you can.


YUMI: Right now I’m by myself,
Odd and Ulrich are at the academic review.


JEREMIE: Oh rats! Aelita can you send a text message
and tell them we’ve got an emergency?


MR. DELMAS: Well then, how should we begin?
Shall we treat the student case files in ascending or descending alphabetical order?


Della Robbia, I wish you would show a little courtesy,
cellphones are forbidden here, turn yours off.


ODD: I’m sorry sir.


MR. DELMAS: Well then, whom should we begin with?


Abulavas, or Zelcovitch?


ULRICH: Zelcovitch.
MS. HERTZ: Abulavas.


MR. DELMAS: Ladies choice. We being then with the case file of Ms. Soriya Abulavas.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Virtualization.


YUMI: We’re okay Jeremie, we’ve reached the edge of the Mountain sector.


JEREMIE: Okay, I’m sending you the transporter.


Holosphere system, connected.


AELITA: The key is over there, just on the other side.


YUMI: Let’s go.


MR. DELMAS: Right, and now let’s look at the file of Jeremie Belpois.


DEFAULT: All’s well, nothing to add.


MS. HERTZ: Yes, I think that everyone would agree with me when I say
that he’s exemplary student. In short, he never makes a mistake.


ULRICH: Never makes a mistake, you must be kidding.


MS. HERTZ: Mr. Morales, sports aren’t everything you know.


MR. DELMAS: Alright, next student.


YUMI: At your service.


JEREMIE: Now, take the next passage on your left.


{\i1}And now, go right.


MR. DELMAS: Does everyone agree that Della Robbia has remarkable potential,
and that as he’s as lazy as day is long?


ODD: But wait, personally I think he’s made a lot of progress,
especially in gym, isn’t that so Mr. Morales.


ULRICH: Yes yes, a lot of progress.


The other students aren’t afraid anymore when it’s his turn to throw the javelin
and he stopped dropping the shot-put on his toes.


MR. DELMAS: Alright, I’ll make a note of that in his file.


YUMI: Ulrich?


ULRICH: Supersprint.


JEREMIE: He’s closing in on the great hall at the Core of Lyoko,
try not to lose him, okay?


YUMI: {\i1}That’s easy for you to say, he’s fast!


AELITA: Jeremie?


JEREMIE: {\i1}He changed directions, you see another way out?


AELITA: No, just a shaft.


JEREMIE: {\i1}That’s it, go ahead jump!


MR. DELMAS: So now, we come to the case of Ulrich Stern.


Anyone care for some turnip soup,
I’m afraid that’s all there is.


DEFAULT: I think we have a serious problem.


MR. DELMAS: Yes, this is scandalous, they could’ve left some sort of variety,
like tomato or vegetable or even just coffee.


DEFAULT: No, I was referring to Ulrich Stern.


MS. HERTZ: He has simply stopped working, he does absolutely nothing at all.


His grades are terrible, at best as far I’m concerned I recommend he’d be transferred down to
ninth grade remedial where he has a vague chance of catching up.


MR. DELMAS: Right, so is everyone in agreement?


DEFAULT: (MURMURING IN AGREEMENT)


ULRICH: I do not agree at all.


ODD: And neither do I.


MR. DELMAS: Go on, you have the floor Jim.


ULRICH: You can’t make a decision only on my- his grades.


They’re far from excellent, I’m not denying that.
But to go from there and say I’m not- that he doesn’t lift a finger is an awful lot to assume.


And don’t forget that you were-


MR. DELMAS: We were what?


ULRICH: You were once adolescents.


JEREMIE: He’s reached the great hall at the Core of Lyoko.


{\i1}Hurry up ladies, can you see a way in?


AELITA: No, it’s a dead end.


JEREMIE: {\i1}What luck… XANA must have opened up a passage for him
leading directly into the Core of Lyoko.


YUMI: What about you, can you do the same?


JEREMIE: No, I wish I could, but you’ll have to go by way of the Celestial Dome.


AELITA: {\i1}Okay, we’ll take the elevator.


ULRICH: Remember how much your emotions affected your work at school.


Who in this room can say they’ve never felt lost?
Never had problems with their parents…


Never had girl or boy problems?
Stern is gonna straighten now, he promised me.


So seriously now, don’t you all think he deserves a second chance?


MR. DELMAS: Well if you look at it from that point of view,
then we might want to reconsider his case.


DEFAULT: (MURMURING IN AGREEMENT)


MS. HERTZ: I disagree completely.
And as the senior teacher I feel absolutely bound to impose my veto.


Stern should be transferred to the ninth grade remedial and that’s all.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Hurry, the shield layer of the sphere just took a 30 point energy hit.


YUMI: Jeremie.
We’re almost there, can you program our vehicles?


MR. DELMAS: Come on Susanne,
you were a teenager once you know.


MS. HERTZ: Yes of course I was, but I still stand by my decision.


ULRICH: Susanne, can I have a word with you?


Listen Susanne, if you give Stern a second chance,
then, uh, you have my word that I’ll teach you the tango...


the rumba, cha-cha-cha and any other stupid-uh,
ballroom dance you want, I swear.


MS. HERTZ: Well then, alright. Since everyone’s against me,
we will leave that thumb-twiddling Mr. Stern in his class.


ULRICH: Yeah!


MS. HERTZ: But if he doesn’t shape up, I’ll ship him out.


ODD: Can I please go to the bathroom?


ULRICH: Me too sir. The, uh, the emotion you know what I mean.


ODD: Jeremie, we’re here.


JEREMIE: About time, Ulrich first of all you’ve gotta leave Jim’s body, now.


ULRICH: Hope he doesn’t flip out on us.


ODD: I bet this’ll be something he’d rather not talk about.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Odd, I’m sending you over right now.
Ulrich, you wait in one of the cabins.


The minute your body devirtualizes I’ll refusion it with your mind,
just be patient, {\i1}okay?{\i0}


ULRICH: Just don’t mess it up this time Einstein.


JEREMIE: Transfer, Odd.


Scanner, Odd.


Virtualization.


AELITA: Energy field!


YUMI: Who went and left our gym teacher on the floor asleep?


JEREMIE: Odd, move it!
There’s only one shield layer protecting the Core of Lyoko.


ODD: Move it, huh? Easy for you to say.
I only have two legs, you know?


Oh, perfect timing Einstein.


JEREMIE: Odd, one more blow with his saber
and the second shield layer’s destroyed.


ODD: Laser arrow!


XANA: Triplicate.


ODD: We’re okay Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Ulrich, now’s the time.
I’m starting up your fusion.


ULRICH: Ah it’s a great feeling to have my body back.


Stop!
There, under your foot.


JIM: Thank you Stern, saved me that one.
But uh, why did you do that?


ULRICH: Let’s just say, that I’ve been in your shoes.


JIM: Well done my boy, I can see something positive has gone into that head of yours.


MS. HERTZ: Jim! I’m ready to dance.
What should we start with? Tango, Pasodoble, Rumba?


JIM: Personally I’m starting with a hot cup of coffee and six donuts.
After that I got jogging with the eight graders.


MS. HERTZ: But, what about my ballroom dance lessons?
You promised me!


JIM: Hey, hey, hey, hey Susanne.


I think you had one too many herbal teas last night.
They do weird things to your head.
