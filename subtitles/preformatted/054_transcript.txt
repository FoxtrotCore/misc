ULRICH: Odd, Will you kill that dumb alarm?

Odd!

DEFAULT: Here are the photocopies you asked me for, Odd.

You wanted 31, is that right?

ODD: That’s right, 31. Thank you.

ULRICH: Rise and shine Einstein, the birds are chirping away.

Jeremy…

Odd and Aelita are going out with each other.

JEREMIE: What? Oh, it’s you Ulrich. Awful joke.

Anyway, what’s the time?

ULRICH: What’s the story, you’ve given up sleeping in a bed or what?

JEREMIE: Well, I was trying to find a way to send you guys into the Internet
so you can track Xana.

ULRICH: Did you figure something out?

JEREMIE: No.

ULRICH: Just look at you, no one’s gonna vote for you.

They’re not voting for a ”zombie of the year” but for their student rep.

JEREMIE: It’s not about how you look, it’s all about what you have to say.

ULRICH: At least you’re optimistic. Can’t hurt I guess.

Anyway you got one thing going for you, you’re up the lamest candidate in the galaxy.

SISSI: Now, how about giving me the smile of a real winner.

Hey what’s that?

HERB: A smile of victory.

SISSI: We’ll never win at this rate.

HERB: Why don’t you run then, Sissi?

SISSI: I can’t, the principal’s daughter isn’t allowed to be a class rep.

Therefore, the new student rep is gonna be you, and definitely not Jeremie.

Do I make myself perfectly clear?

That’s what I like to see, a nice winner’s smile.

HERB: That’s not a smile Sissi, you’re crushing my knee-caps.

ODD: Take a copy of my platform.

JEREMIE: Platform, but for what?

ODD: My platform, you are looking at the next student rep.

JEREMIE: You’re running Odd? Why didn’t you say anything?

ODD: Because surprise is the secret weapon of my election campaign.

AELITA: And the second weapon is poetry.

If you all want to have your say, why not give the nod to good old Odd?

ODD: Hey, it’s great. I love lines that rhyme with Odd.

JIM: I’m warning you, anyone tries to pull anything, detention.

You can join that smart-alec William Dunbar in the study hall.

MS. HERTZ: Thank you Jim, I think you’ve made yourself clear.

JIM: Roger Susan.

I’m sorry, I mean Ms. Hertz.

MS. HERTZ: Fine, Let’s not forget what we’re going to be looking for!

The purpose of our field trip today is to witness the
early effects of pollution on our ecosystem and especially in the forest.

Effects that might some day mean the end of our forest, and all animal and plant-life of course.

JIM: Are you saying there won’t be anymore bunny-rabbits, 
or little birds, or trees and mushrooms that would all disappear?

Oh wow, I love that perfume.

ODD: And so I ask you, why should good students represent the bad?

Why not let a near dropout like me speak for all the other near dropouts?

HERB: You’re not smiling Jeremie, how come?

JEREMIE: Because I don’t wanna look as dorky as you Herb, okay?

ODD: What do Belpois and Pinchon know about our problems, huh?

They always get A’s and B’s, right?
They don’t know the fear of getting left back.

They’re not capable of defending our cause.

ULRICH: Bravo, good point Odd! Okay near dropouts, 
it’s time for all of us to take a stand!

DEFAULT: Odd sure gets my vote, he’s gonna be a great student rep, cause he knows what we need.

TEACHER: Right now, quiet down.

SFX: (ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)

JIM: Don’t be scared, you gotta put her down when you’re in the jungle.

DEFAULT: What’s going on?

YUMI: What’s the matter, are we already the-

Oh no…

HERB: In conclusion, I promise to put lots of pretty plants in each and every one of your classrooms.

Won’t that be nice, huh?

SISSI: Yeah, bravo bravo, way to go Herb!
Clap stupid go on, go on!

I’m gonna vote for Herb, aren’t you?

ODD: Your turn at bat now, Einstein.

JEREMIE: Odd, this is not a game.
Being elected as the class rep is really serious with lots of responsibilities.

ODD: And you don’t think I’m capable of handling them.

JEREMIE: I never said that.

ODD: No, but that’s what you're thinking.

Well answer it, it’s probably some think-tank that wants your precious advice.

JEREMIE: Hello. Yumi?

YUMI: Jeremie! I’m in real big trouble, my whole class has been Xanafied!

JEREMIE: Are you sure?

TEACHER: If you don’t mind Belpois, we’re all waiting for you.

JEREMIE: Yumi, look I’ve gotta hang up, but don’t worry.

Xana’s just launched an attack.

TEACHER: Jeremie, if you’re still a candidate speak up.
What’s your platform?

JEREMIE: Well, I… I had some notes, but I left them back in my room.

I’ll go and get them.

ODD: I’ll go with him.

Keep an eye on the competition.

ULRICH: And we better go too, to separate them if they start fighting.

HERB: Vote for me everyone.

TEACHER: I don’t believe this.

JEREMIE: Attack confirmed! Xana has activated a tower.

ULRICH: Yumi, where are you?

YUMI: At the red trail crossroads, you better hurry. I can’t hold out much longer.

ULRICH: Be right there.

JEREMIE: Okay, Ulrich you head for the forest,
and we’ll see what we can do about the activated tower on Lyoko.

{\i1}The activated tower is in the Forest sector.{\i0}
I’ll try to get you in as close as possible.

Transfer, Aelita.
Transfer, Odd.

Scanner, Odd.

Scanner, Aelita.

Virtualization.

ODD: Okay, we’re here Jeremie.

JEREMIE: {\i1}The tower is due north.
You should be able to see it from where you are.

ODD: Can’t miss it.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Here’s your taxi.


ODD: Hop aboard, we’re off.


JEREMIE: Xana is sending you some monsters, how original can you get.


ODD: He hates it when we’re bored.


Okay, let’s be polite. We’ll say hello to them first.


JEREMIE: Hey Odd, take care of yourself. 

If anything happened to you,
I wouldn’t have any competition except for Herb.


ODD: Don’t worry Einstein, I’ll take care of them, and then I’ll go after you.


Laser arrow!


Let’s turn around.


Uh-oh.


Aelita!


JEREMIE: You better be careful Aelita,
lots of Tarantulas are on the way!


ODD: You just can’t stay away from me, huh?


AELITA: It looks like they can’t either.


SFX: (ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)


JIM: (CHUCKLING)


ULRICH: C’mon Yumi, pick up.


What are you doing here, what are you following me for?


WILLIAM: I heard it all, Yumi’s in trouble.
I came to see if I could help.


ULRICH: I don’t know what you’re talking abou-


YUMI: :yumimoan:
WILLIAM: Now do you know what I’m talking about?


ODD: I’ll try to keep them busy. 
Soon as the coast is clear, head for the tower.


AELITA: Okay.


ODD: Well, you gotta go...


JEREMIE: {\i1}Nice going, Odd.


{\i1}Wait Aelita. They’re still too close.


WILLIAM: Hey that’s Jim shooting lightning out of his fingers.
Is this a nightmare or what?


ULRICH: William do you wanna help Yumi or not?
Then don’t say anything, and do what I tell you.


JEREMIE: Aelita, go!


Ulrich?


ULRICH: What Jeremie?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita is heading for the tower.
She should be shutting it down in about five minutes.


ULRICH: Good, because I’m getting ready to do something risky with William.


JEREMIE: William? What are you and William doing together?
Are you two guys buddies now?


ULRICH: {\i1}Nah, he’s giving me a hand I’ll explain later.


JEREMIE: Yeah, well--


AELITA: {\i1}Jeremie, I’ve got a big problem.


JEREMIE: Scyphozoa.


AELITA: {\i1}But why? It’s already got all the data that Xana needed from me,
what can it want now?


JEREMIE: I don’t know Aelita, but please don’t stick around trying to find out.


JEREMIE: Ulrich, change of the program. The tower is not gonna get deactivated right away.


ULRICH: I guess we can’t count on you guys.


How’re ya doing zombies? 
Oh, I know I’m not welcome but I love strolling in the woods.


JIM: After him!


WILLIAM: Yumi.


Yumi!


JEREMIE: Aelita, try to hit him with the energy field.


No!


ODD: {\i1}Jeremie, what’s going on?


JEREMIE: The scyphozoa’s attacked Aelita, hurry she needs your help!


ODD: I’d love to help, but my new playmate doesn’t seem to agree.


JEREMIE: I don’t get it. It looks like the Scyphozoa has implanted something into Aelita’s memory.


ODD: Almost there Jeremie!


JEREMIE: Aelita is alive! I don’t understand.


ODD: Aelita, you gotta wake up. It’s me, Odd!


Yoo-hoo! Hey come on, you can take a nap later.


Jeremie, got a problem here.


Something’s wrong with Aelita.


JEREMIE: Aelita answer me, it’s Jeremie. Wake up, come on.


ODD: Jeremie, what’s going on?


JEREMIE: Find your overboard and follow Aelita.


ODD: What about the tower?


ULRICH: 15 against one, huh? I’ve been through worse.


YUMI: Jeremie, what’s going on with the tower?
I’m back and ready to go, but it’s Ulrich who’s in trouble this time.


JEREMIE: There’s only a slim chance of deactivating the tower right away.


YUMI: {\i1}How slim?


JEREMIE: To be honest, none at all.


YUMI: Ready to fight William?


SFX: (ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)


YUMI: Yoo-hoo


JIM: Grab that girl!


WILLIAM: Banzai!

JIM: Go after him, right now!


SFX: (WHISTLING)


WILLIAM: You taught us that wood doesn’t conduct electricity.


JEREMIE: Can you hear me Odd? What’s going on?


ODD: I get the feeling that Aelita’s heading for the waytower.


JEREMIE: Just what we needed.


Aelita?


ODD: What is going on?


AELITA: Odd, what happened to me?


ODD: I’ll tell you about it later. 
Right now, let’s run for it!


JEREMIE: What’s happening now?


ODD: The sector’s disappearing! Rematerialize us!


JEREMIE: {\i1}The activated tower.


ULRICH: Are you okay? William’s not in great shape.


YUMI: Jeremie, did you manage to get the tower deactivated?


JEREMIE: I didn’t. It deactivated itself, because the Forest sector is in the process of disappearing.


DEFAULT: {\i1}What?


ODD: Jeremie!


JEREMIE: Rematerialization.


AELITA: I don’t know what happened.


ODD: Well for one thing, it was a really close call. 


Otherwise, I don’t know what happened either,
but I’m sure Einstein can tell us.


YUMI: Look over there! That moss must be the result of pollution.


I love science field trips.


ULRICH: Okay, naptime, but don’t you dare dream about Yumi.


WILLIAM: Wow, what a nightmare.


JEREMIE: It’s no use, the Forest sector doesn’t exist anymore.
Xana has totally wiped it off the map.


AELITA: If only I hadn’t gone in to that waytower,
and if only I hadn’t punched in that code.


JEREMIE: Don’t you see, Xana used you Aelita.
He launched an attack just to lure us to Lyoko.


ODD: But why would he do that?


JEREMIE: If the surface sectors disappear we won’t be able to get to Sector Five anymore.


ODD: You mean that Xana’s gonna destroy all the sectors?


JEREMIE: Sure is.


If only I could find a way to directly materialize you directly into Sector Five.
Looks like I’ve got plenty of work ahead.


Well, it’s a good thing I’m not gonna get elected class rep.


ODD: How do you know that?


JEREMIE: Easy, cause we’re all gonna vote for you.


TEACHER: And your newly elected class representative is…


Odd Della-Robbia.


SISSI: Nicholas, don’t tell me you voted for Odd too.


NICHOLAS: Yeah.


SISSI: Take that grin of your face dorkhead.


DEFAULT: Odd! Odd! Odd!


Now that you’re a class rep, you think you could get me out of gym class?


ODD: Hey cool it, calm down, one at a time okay?
