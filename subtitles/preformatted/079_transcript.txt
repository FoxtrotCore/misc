79 - Bragging Rights


ULRICH: Uh oh


To think this was supposed to be a piece of cake.


DEFAULT: Several hours earlier...


JIM: I’ll say it once more for those of you
who were daydreaming.


One, run up. Two, jump onto the springboard.
Three, push off of the horse.


Four, pipe vault, and Five, land feet together on the mat.
You got that?


HERB: No, I didn’t get it at all, coach.
So would you mind giving us a demonstration, Jim?


JIM: What’s the matter with you, Pichon?


There’s nothing to it,
only a halfwit couldn’t manage it.


ODD: One… two… three…


JIM: (GRUNTING)


ODD: He got to five without doing four!


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


JIM: Pichon, funny huh?


Let’s see what you can do.


And don’t forget those five golden rules.


ODD: (LAUGHING) That horse ought to be in the rodeo!


JIM: Della Robbia, front and center,
it’s your turn to fall flat on your face.


ODD: Okay.


DEFAULT: (GASPS)


ODD: Well how was that?
You’re right, Jim, only a halfwit couldn’t manage it.


Come on, I don’t believe it, I do a vault
worthy of the Olympics, and bam, four hours of detention.


Is that the kind of payoff I deserve?


ULRICH: Well yeah.


ODD: Huh?


ULRICH: Come on, Odd, the way you spoke to Jim was-


ODD: Was what?


ULRICH: Obnoxious, pretentious…


ODD: Pretentious? No one’s more humble than I am.


JEREMIE: Who are you trying to kid, your middle name
ought to be “braggart”, Odd.


AELITA: That’s for sure, I can’t remember even one day
that you didn’t sing your own praises.


ODD: Hey, that is so wrong, and I can prove it to you, too.


ULRICH: Okay, I’ll be you a week of deserts
that you can’t go twenty four hours without bragging.


ODD: You’re on!


I know someone who just won himself some yummy seconds.


ULRICH: Yeah, me!


ODD: Uh uh, me!


ULRICH: No, me.


JEREMIE: Hey, are you guys all through?


Maybe I ought to remind you that we’re supposed to be--
--blowing up Xana’s supercomputer tonight after class.


ULRICH: In the Jungle? You mean we’re going back already?


AELITA: That’s right, and we don’t think it’ll be a problem.
Odd knocked out the energy field protecting it last time.


ODD: And once again where mere mortals would have failed,
Odd demonstrates his great… uh… modesty and humility.


JEREMIE: So thanks to our non-bragging hero,
it’s gonna be a piece of cake.


{\i1}I’m entering the coordinates of the Replika.


Holoweb system connected.
You should be able to see it now, I’ve got it on radar.


AELITA: {\i1}Affirmative. Skid in position in front of the entrance.
Digital key engaged.


{\i1}Tower in sight, Jeremie.


{\i1}Docking.


{\i1}Gotcha, I’m activating the tower for us.


Are you ready?


ULRICH: {\i1}Ready.[v]


JEREMIE: {\i1}Teleportation, Ulrich.


{\i1}Teleportation, Yumi.


ULRICH: You’re the greatest, Jeremie, it worked.


YUMI: Your teleportation is pretty accurate,
{\i1}we’re in the middle of the lab.{\i0}


JEREMIE: Cut the flattery guys, before it goes to my head. Like Odd.


ODD: I do not have a swelled head.


That being said, considering my extraordinary exploits last
time I don’t see why I wasn’t teleported over.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Gotta give everyone a chance to have fun, Odd.


AELITA: And if the only desert you want to eat for a week
is humble pie, {\i1}just keep it up.{\i0}


ULRICH: Okay Jeremie, which way is it?


JEREMIE: Head east, you’ll go through a door,


then go straight and a little further on at your left
you should see the door to the supercomputer room.


ULRICH: {\i1}Got it, we’re on it.


Huh?


YUMI: Huh?


ULRICH: Bingo.


JEREMIE: Great, all you’ve got to do now is open the door and trash
the supercomputer. We told you this would be no problem.


SFX: (BEEPING)


YUMI: Jeremie, why can’t I get the door open?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Oh right, the last time Aelita used
her digital power to open it.


{\i1}Hang on, I’ll figure out something.


ULRICH: Let me handle this.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Uh, Ulrich, wait!


ULRICH: Uh, too late.


YUMI: Great, now the panel’s dead and the door is still locked.


JEREMIE: What an idiot! I said to wait, Ulrich!


ULRICH: {\i1}Well you should have said it sooner.


{\i1}What do we do now?


JEREMIE: Hold on.


I’ve got an idea. You guys have to {\i1}cut the power
to the door’s electromagnetic locking mechanism.{\i0}


ULRICH: You know where the generator is?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Yeah, I’ll guide you there.


YUMI: I’ll stay here. As soon as it opens,
I’ll go in and get rid of the supercomputer.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Ulrich, turn around and go back to the first intersection,{\i0}
then take the corridor on the right.


ULRICH: {\i1}I’m on my way, Einstein.


AELITA: Jeremie, can you hear us?


Everything okay?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Uh, just a little problem. No sweat, everything’s cool.


ODD: Are you sure?
Because I’d love to go and help Ulrich and Yumi.


Modestly of course.


JEREMIE: Sorry Odd, but you’ve got your work cut out for you
already. I just spotted an activated tower.


AELITA: {i\1}We’re on it, Jeremie.


{\i1}Get ready to disembark, Odd.


Disembark.


ODD: Einstein, could you send us a-


JEREMIE: {\i1}What were you saying, Odd?


ODD: Uh, nothing, thanks.


AELITA: Uh oh. It looks like we’ve got a little problem here too.


JEREMIE: I see William, and three Hornets.


AELITA: Jeremie, should Odd stay here and fight them off
while I deactivate the tower?


JEREMIE: {\i1}No, the Tower’s too far away
and Odd could never handle them alone.


ODD: Four Hornets and Sir William the low life?


Four Laser Arrows and it’s game over.


AELITA: Odd, forget your bet.


ODD: (LAUGHING) That isn’t bragging, it’s the simple truth.


Shield!


You see? Lucky for us I was here.


JEREMIE: Listen, it’s easy, just hold off William long enough
for Ulrich to neutralize the generator,


it’ll only take a few minutes.


ODD: No problem.


JEREMIE: Ulrich, do you read me? Where are you?


ULRICH: {\i1}In front of the generator.


JEREMIE: That’s great, tell me how it looks.


ULRICH: Well, it’s this huge machine with a bunch of
flashing thing-a-majigs all over it.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Okay, now just neutralize the commutator
that powers the Lab doors.


ULRICH: The commu-what?


JEREMIE: {\i1}The button! Do you see a little red button?


ULRICH: There’s not just one, there are millions of them,
this thing is lit up like a pinball machine.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Just proceed by elimination.


ULRICH: No, I’m gonna do this my way.


JEREMIE: Your way, huh Ulrich? Like smashing up the generator with
your sabre and short circuiting the supercomputer?


ULRICH: {\i1}You guessed it.


JEREMIE: Uh, give me a minute to think it over.


ODD: This way, kitties!


SFX: (GLASS SHATTERING)


YUMI: Hm?


ODD: Laser Arrow!


Laser Arrow!


If I tell them this, they’ll say I’m bragging again!


YUMI: Hm?


SFX: (GLASS SHATTERING)


YUMI: Jeremie, remind me of what there is in the vivarium.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Cybernetic spiders.


YUMI: Hm.


(GASPS)


You guys are ugly.


(SCREAMS)


I’ve had enough of your cyber spiderweb.


Jeremie, those cyber spiders are being controlled
by Xana and they’re just behind me!


JEREMIE: Not for long, the supercomputer should be offline
in just a couple of seconds.


Ulrich, your idea isn’t big on finesse,
but it should work. Do it.


ULRICH: Okay.


YUMI: Hey Jeremie, whenever you want for that short circuit.


JEREMIE: Right now.


YUMI: (SIGHS)


ODD: Huh? Where’d it go?


Wow, even my looks blow them away.


Jeremie, what’s happening?


JEREMIE: {\i1}We did it!


ODD: Already?


AELITA: Energy field!


JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita, the Replika is disappearing, better get airborne.


WILLIAM: (SCREAMS)


ODD: That was what you call a real swan song dive.


JEREMIE: I told you this’d be a piece of cake.
You can head for the Skid now, your mission’s over, guys.


{\i1}Are you ready, Ulrich? I’m teleporting you back.


ULRICH: Oh hold on, I think something’s up.


JEREMIE: {\i1}What?


ULRICH: The power’s back on.


SFX: (ALARM SOUNDING)


ODD: Uh, Jeremie, is the Replika supposed to be regenerating?


JEREMIE: No it’s not supposed to.
Ulrich, there’s got to be a backup generator somewhere.


ULRICH: {\i1}No kidding, even I could have figure that out.
Only where is it?


JEREMIE: How do I know? I’m looking for it.


ULRICH: Better hurry up, I’m going back to Yumi.


YUMI: Jeremie, how come you haven’t teleported me back yet?
And what’s that alarm?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Oh, just a little hang up, nothing important.


YUMI: (GASPS) I see.


(SCREAMS)


ULRICH: Not so fast.


Come on.


ULRICH: Well Jeremie, where is this backup generator?


JEREMIE: I still can’t find it.


ULRICH: {\i1}Better take care of those spiders
before they take care of us.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita, you have to deactivate the tower.
Odd, you stay and protect the Skid.


ODD: Oh no, why do I have to stay while everyone else
is having fun?


AELITA: Odd…


ODD: What? That wasn’t bragging.


WILLIAM: (GRUNTS)


ODD: Great!


Somebody just showed up and wants to play with me.


Go on, Aelita.


Feel like playing tag?


ULRICH: Whoa!


Oh no.


To think this was supposed to be a piece of cake.


JEREMIE: Aelita, better hurry, Ulrich and Yumi are in a huge jam.


AELITA: I’m doing what I can… I’ve still got a ways to go.


WILLIAM: For Xana!


ODD: For me!


Gotcha!


Stings, doesn’t it?


WILLIAM: Super smoke!


ODD: Laser Arrow!


(WHISTLES)


WILLIAM: Huh?


ODD: Laser Arrow!


(SIGHS)


JEREMIE: Odd, did you just blow William away by yourself?


ODD: {\i1}Yep!


JEREMIE: No boasting?


ODD: What do you think I am? A braggart?


JEREMIE: Hm.


Yumi and Ulrich, I just located the auxiliary generator.


ULRICH: Thanks, but it’s a little too late.


DEFAULT: (SCREAMING)


JEREMIE: Yumi! Ulrich!


ODD: Jeremie, you there? What happened to the two lovebirds?


Hm, interesting. I get it, they knock each other out.


{\i1}Well Jeremie, we kinda blew our mission, didn’t we?


JEREMIE: Not at all, I found the auxiliary generator, but the problem
is there isn’t anyone around to take it out.


ODD: I don’t want to seem pretentious, but there’s me.


JEREMIE: Okay, get back into the Skid, I’ll teleport you.


ODD: {\1i}Roger, but once I succeed,
don’t say I did it just to show off.


{\i1}I’m ready to go, Jeremie.


JEREMIE: {\i1}I read you.


Teleportation, Odd.


ODD: What now?


JEREMIE: Get out of the lab and watch out for spiders.


ODD: {\i1}I can’t see any hairy legs yet.


JEREMIE: Well I can, Odd.


SFX: (SCREECHING)


JEREMIE: Ulrich, Yumi, you gotta get up, and fast, too.
If the Skid goes, so do you. Get up!


ODD: Jeremie, I’m out of the lab. Which way now?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Go left. You should run right into the auxiliary generator.


ODD: Huh? Uh oh.
That generator’s a really popular spot, isn’t it?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Why?


ODD: Because it looks like there’s a full house.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita, you have to deactivate that tower right away.


AELITA: Almost there.


Just a few seconds more.


Oh no!


(SCREAMS)


Huh?


JEREMIE: (GASPS) Odd…


ODD: I don’t believe it, let me guess,
I’m on my own from now on, right?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Sorry about that.


Better make it fast, too, or else we can say goodbye
to the Skid, Ulrich, and Yumi for good.


{\i1}Okay, Odd, it’s now or never.


ODD: Geronimo!


Laser Arrow!


Hi there.


Jeremie, I need ammunition!


JEREMIE: Hang on a second.


I’m reloading you now.


Okay, you’re all set.


ODD: Laser Arrow!


Yes!


How’s that for a pipe valut?


JEREMIE: Odd, you’ve got just one arrow left, {\i1}so take good aim{\i0}.


ODD: One arrow is all I need.


Huh?


(SCREAMS)


Can’t say I didn’t aim well.


JEREMIE: De-teleportation, Odd.


ODD: Hey, nice place you’ve got here, Aelita.


ULRICH: Huh? What’s going on?


ODD: Nothing, things are cool. Go back to sleep.


JEREMIE: You can come back, Odd. It’s over.


ODD: I’m off!


JEREMIE: (SIGHS)


AELITA: You were right, you know.
You couldn’t have asked for an easier mission.


ULRICH: He took out both William and the supercomputer on his own?
That’s crazy.


JEREMIE: What’s crazier is that he hasn’t
bragged about it even once.


ULRICH: That’s weird.


JEREMIE: Who knows, maybe he’s changed.


ULRICH: You mean he’s suddenly become humble?


JEREMIE: Miracles happen.
He might have become a sensible, responsible kid.


ODD: Yeehaw! Forty point one seconds flat!


You are now looking at the new world record holder
for the fastest shower! How cool is that?


Gimme an O!


Gimme a D!


Gimme another D!


Who’s the man of the century? It’s Odd!


And you’re handsome, too.
Oh, I love it when you break records like that.


ULRICH: Odd…


ODD: Yeah right, no problem, you can have my deserts.


(GRUNTING)


ULRICH: And you don’t even care?


ODD: I guess I’ve got to face facts.
Yes, I’m a braggart, and I love it that way.


Svelte, but muscular, don’t you think?
