78 - Lab Rat


DEFAULT: (CHATTERING)


ODD: What’s the big news?


We can’t wait to hear it.


JEREMIE: I found it, at last.


ODD: What?


How to build up your muscles without any exercising?


JEREMIE: Funny, no!


I figured out how to materialize you onto Earth
From the network.


Actually, it was much easier than I thought it would be.


I applied the synchronicity principle
to the supercomputer’s apparatus,


and then I used it to develop
a kind of energizing projection.


In other words-


ODD: In English then, that means you now know
how to send us somewhere directly on Earth


from inside the network, right?


JEREMIE: Exactly!


ULRICH: You understood Einstein’s babbling?


ODD: Well yeah-


After all this time I’m finally starting
to get the hang of {\i1}swampum physics{\i0}.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Quantum...


ODD: Yeah, well it’s still muddy though.


ULRICH: Hold it, that means that now
you can bring us up anywhere from the Skid?


JEREMIE: Not anywhere at all, but I can do it in the vicinity
of a supercomputer generating a copy.


It’s what I call teleportation.


YUMI: Hi guys, what’s up?


AELITA: Are you ready to go and blow up a supercomputer?


YUMI: You can get us to the real world from the network?


JEREMIE: Yeah, we’re all meeting at the factory tonight
To try it out, okay?


YUMI: You got it!


AELITA: Bye!


ULRICH: Uh, Yumi?
I wanted to ask you something.


YUMI: {\i1}Hmph


ODD: Wow!
Now that was about as cold as the north pole!


What did you do to deserve that?


ULRICH: I have no idea.


The cold shoulder started the day before yesterday.


ODD: That’s weird-
Her birthday was the day before yesterday.


ULRICH: {\i1}It was?!


I don’t believe it!
You’re kidding!


ODD: I hope you wished her a happy birthday.
You know how important things like that are to her.


ULRICH: Oh no!
I totally forgot!


Man, I bet now she’s gonna hate me for weeks!


ODD: Probably, unless you go and buy her a nice present-
to make up for it.


ULRICH: I'll go now.


Well, I would if I could...


JIM: Stern, how many times to I have to tell you
that a flounder is not a flying fish.


So there's no reason to throw it at the window!


Especially when the window is open,
and when I happen to be there.


So I've got one word for you,
and that's two hours of study hall!


ULRICH: You're making a mistake, I swear to you Jim!


JIM: Well Stern, you're right.
This time, I did make a mistake.


It's not two hours, but four hours of study hall!
And if you keep {\i1}baiting{\i0} me,


I'll make sure that you don't get off the {\i1}hook{\i0} for eight hours!


ULRICH: Thanks to Jim, I've got four hours of detention.


And then we have Chardin's class and-


ODD: No sweat, I gotta go get a few things for Kiwi.
And while I'm out, I'll pick up a little present for Yumi.


ULRICH: Really?
You’d do that for me?


ODD: Yeah, sure.


Besides- I owe you one.


In case you didn’t know, the flying fish thing was me.


ULRICH: {\i1}It was{\i0} and you let me take the blame!?


ODD: I was laughing too hard to tell Jim!


ULRICH: Oh Odd, you know I outta-


ODD: Hey, would you stop hating me for a minute Ulrich?
Here.


This should get you on the good side of your platonic friend.


ULRICH: Hey, thanks Odd.


What is it?


ODD: A surprise.


Yumi’s really gonna go for it, don’t worry.


JEREMIE: Hey you guys- Hello!


You don’t mind keeping up with the rest of us I hope!


Do I have to remind you
That we have a really important mission?


ODD: Okay, okay-
Hey, we’re not factory workers!


ULRICH: Well, technically we are.


YUMI: How did your classes go today?


AELITA: Not bad, how ‘bout you?


YUMI: Fine.


JEREMIE: You guys ready?


{\i1}Energize!


Standing by for liftoff.


AELITA: {\i1}Standing by.


JEREMIE: Supports away.


AELITA: {\i1}Ignition- powering vertical.


{\i1}Liftoff.


Okay-


Shields- activated.


Sonar- activated.


Stabilizers- online, and checked.


Primary access- clear.


Laser generators- online.


Ready to dive.


JEREMIE: {\i1}I’m entering the coordinates of the replika.


Holoweb system- online.


Okay, you’re looking for a hub at 0, 4, 5.


AELITA: {\i1}Gotcha Jeremie.
{\i1}Course heading- set.


AELITA: I’m powering up the turboprops
And auxiliary engines.


ODD: Replika, here we go again!


ULRICH: Can’t somebody shut him up?


YUMI: Why? He’s nice at least.


ODD: Incredible, they’re talking to each other.


DEFAULT: Shut up, Odd.


AELITA: {\i1}Get ready-
{\i1}Broadband acceleration in
{\i1}Three, two, one, zero!


{\i1}Reverse thrust!


{\i1}We’re clear Jeremie!


JEREMIE: Yeah, I know.


You guys ought to be able to see the replika now.


AELITA: {\i1}Yes, it’s right in front of us.


We’re heading for the entry portal.


Digital key activated.


{\i1}I'm sending you the signal, Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Roger.


I’m about to open it up.


Uh oh, there's an activated tower on the replika.


AELITA: That's means that Xana is up to no good
somewhere on Earth not far from


the supercomputer we're looking for.


But what?


JEREMIE: If we wanna know we gotta-


ULRICH: {\i1}Hey Einstein,
{\i1}what if we gave your teleportation thing a try…


{\i1}Just to be sure once and for all!


JEREMIE: That’s what I was thinking-
But first, you're gonna have to moor the Skid to a tower.


{\i1}There's one nearby- at three o'clock.


AELITA: {\i1}I see it, Jeremie.


{\i1}It looks good.


I should be able to secure the Skid to it.


JEREMIE: Gently though…


A little to the left…


Be careful!


ODD: Backseat driving again!
Better cut it out.


JEREMIE: Sorry, Aelita.
I know you can do it without me.


AELITA: Ready to moor.


{\i1}Skid- secured.


ODD: {\i1}Nice one, princess.


JEREMIE: Good job!


Now just give me a minute to
activate the tower for our own use!


{\i1}Well, we’re all set!


Okay guys, it’s time.


Ready for teleportation?


ULRICH: Ready to go Einstein.


JEREMIE: Teleportation.


ULRICH: It didn’t work Jeremie,
I’m still here!


JEREMIE: {\i1}That’s normal.


I forgot to tell you..
That this time I decided to energize only Aelita and Odd.


I’d rather you stayed with Yumi to protect the Skid.


If it’s anything like our last experiment,
XANA will be sending you a welcoming committee


In no time flat.


ULRICH: If you you’d have told us before-
We could have chosen sides ourselves.


YUMI: Great, you really sound happy to be with me…


ULRICH: That wasn’t what I meant!


JEREMIE: Okay, you guys know the procedure.


I’ll put you ashore while I get a little work done.


Aelita, Odd?
Do you read me?


Uh- Aelita? Odd?


Aelita!


Odd!


I wish I knew what was happening!


ODD: {\i1}Cool Einstein!


JEREMIE: {\i1}AHH!


ODD: {\i1}It works!


JEREMIE: Glad to hear it,
but that's no reason to blow out my eardrum!


Okay, where are you?


ODD: {\i1}You’re not gonna believe this,
{\i1}but we're in the jungle!


AELITA: {\i1}And it’s daytime here…


JEREMIE: I get it-
You’re in a different timezone.


You’re in the amazon region it seems.


AELITA: Wow, that’s exciting.


ODD: But we’re dressed like on Lyoko- how come?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Because the teleportation isn't
{\i1}Isn't a real devirtualization.


{\i1}Those aren't your real human forms
{\i1}I materialized onto Earth, but they-


ODD: Whoa whoa, slow down Frank-Einstein-


Are you trying to tell us that we're not really us?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Yes, you're you, but those aren't your real bodies-


{\i1}More like some kind of specters in the image of
{\i1}your virtual manifestation.


ODD: Aelita and I’ve become specters?


JEREMIE: {\i1}In fact, you're more like polymorphic specters that-


ODD: {\i1}Wow, pretty impressive…


JEREMIE: If you say so-


It doesn't matter.


For now, hurry up and find the supercomputer!
The teleportation won't last forever.


AELITA: How long have we got?


JEREMIE: Uh... 52, no- 26, no uh- 13…


13 minutes!


ODD: {\i1}The guy's a comedian!


And just where does he expect us to find
a supercomputer- behind a tree?!


AELITA: Good guess, Odd.


ULRICH: Yumi- wait!


Can’t we make up, huh?


You know, if someone forgot my birthday
I wouldn't make a big thing out of it!


YUMI: That’s because I never ever forget it!


ULRICH: {\i1}Ugh!


You know-
{\i1}Ah!


Okay, I- not you-
But I mean somebody-


You- you know-


YUMI: Look, quit while you’re ahead.
You’re just making things worse.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Yumi, Ulrich!


{\i1}Odd and Aelita have found a laboratory.


{\i1}My theory was right.


{\i1}They’re trying to locate the supercomputer.


{\i1}Everything okay on your side?


ULRICH: A little chilly but…


{\i1}D’oh!

WILLIAM: Faster!


YUMI: Jeremie, XANA’s on the move again!


JEREMIE: Okay Yumi.


Two vehicles coming right up!


ULRICH: I’ll take care of handsome!


YUMI: Yeah, right-


JEREMIE: {\i1}Be careful, if the Skid gets disconnected from the tower-
{\i1}it's mission over for Aelita and Odd.


YUMI: We'll try to make life miserable for the enemy,
don't worry!


ULRICH: Fighting William should put me in a better mood…


{\i1}Whew…


ODD: It’s open…


AELITA: Right or left?


ODD: Through there.


AELITA: How can you be so sure?


ODD: Because my sense of direction is infallible.


DEFAULT: (GROWLS)


ULRICH: {\i1}Whoa!


{\i1}Ah


AELITA: {\i1}Hurry up!


{\i1}This way!


ODD: What’s this, huh?


A supermarket display for office plants?


Uh oh, guess not…


JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita, Odd!
{\i1}Hurry up and find the supercomputer!


{\i1}Yumi and Ulrich are busy fighting off a bunch of tarantulas.


ODD: Funny, their cousins are right here…


JEREMIE: {\i1}What are you talking about?


ODD: Uh- nothing, Jeremie.


Aelita, what do you make of these souped-upped spiders?


AELITA: I’d say that XANA wants to transform these tropical tarantulas.


ODD: But for what?


Spiders don’t attack unless you sit on them.


DEFAULT: (THUD)


ODD: {\i1}AH!


AELITA: {\i1}Shhh!


ODD: Okay, okay- don’t look at me in that tone of voice!


Anyway, I’m sure nobody heard anything.


AELITA: What’d you say?


ODD: Laser arrow!


DEFAULT: (GRUNTS)


ODD: Anyone ever teach you to play fair?!


{\i1}Ow!


Hey- that thing really stings!


AELITA: Energy field!


{\i1}Ah!


ULRICH: You’ve lost William!


Oh no!


WILLIAM: (LAUGHS)


ULRICH: What an idiot…


YUMI: Not so fast, pretty-boy!


WILLIAM: It’s over, Yumi.


YUMI: Jeremie, mayday.
SOS.


I need two more fans like- right now!


JEREMIE: Uh oh…
{\i1}Right now{\i0} is a pretty tall order, Yumi.


But okay, lemme see what I can up with.


ODD: Here we go, back in your cage now.


DEFAULT: (ROAR)


ODD: {\i1}Whoa!


AELITA: Hey you!


DEFAULT: (ROARING)


ODD: You’re a great specter!


AELITA: You really think so?


ODD: Well no medals just yet, princess.
We still have to find the supercomputer.


YUMI: Jeremie!


JEREMIE: It’s okay- I’m nearly there!


ULRICH: Well?


JEREMIE: You wouldn't have a rabbit's foot, a four-leaf clover,
or a horseshoe on your, would you?


ULRICH: Is it as bad as all that?


AELITA: Infallible sense of direction, huh?


I was positive that we should have gone
in the other direction.


ODD: Hold on a minute!


Bingo!


AELITA: {\i1}Jeremie, we found the supercomputer!


JEREMIE: Great!
You’d better destroy it right away


Because Yumi can’t hold on much longer!


ODD: Oh no, an entry code!


Why not a couple of guard dogs too…


AELITA: Let me handle it.


Now we gotta get rid of this thing for good.


ODD: Let me handle this one.


Laser arrow!


I don’t believe this.


AELITA: Jeremie, we’ve got a problem


{\i1}The supercomputer has an energy field around it.


JEREMIE: You’ve gotta find out
where the shield is getting its energy from.


I can’t do anything from here,
do whatever you have to but hurry up!


YUMI: Jeremie!
It’s now or never!


Oh Jeremie, I’m really sorry.


AELITA: There!


That must be the lens that’s projecting the energy field!


If we destroy it, there's a good chance
we'll deactivate the shield.


ODD: You could have found me a little bigger target-


No one could possibly hit from this distance…
That is… except me.


AELITA: Go ahead.
I’ll take care of them.


ODD: Laser arrow!


Yeah!


{\i1}Adios amigos!


Laser ar-


JEREMIE: Odd! Aelita!
Come in please!


ODD: What is this?
What’s going on now?


JEREMIE: XANA has taken over control of the tower, you guys.
Your teleportation has stopped.


We've got to abort the mission.
You might as well come home.


{\i1}Wake up, Aelita!


{\i1}Aelita, let’s get out of here!


{\i1}Spiderman and company have just arrived!


AELITA: Okay!


Let’s go!


ULRICH: There's no sense dissing ourselves.
After all, we did our best.


AELITA: Maybe, but we've still gotta find out
what XANA's planning to do with those cybernetic spiders.


JEREMIE: Right.


We'll have to go back onto the replika,
teleport you back in,


and destroy that supercomputer.


ODD: That's fine, but until then,
anyone mind if I sleep for a few years?


YUMI: Okay, we get the message.
We could all use a little sleep.


ULRICH: Uh- Yumi!


YUMI: What now?


ULRICH: Here.
A little birthday gift.


YUMI: Aw, thanks Ulrich.
That’s very sweet!


ULRICH: Aren’t you gonna open it?


YUMI: In Japan, you never open a present in front
of the person who gave it to you.


ULRICH: Well that’s fine with me.


JEREMIE: I bet you’re thinking about your own birthday…


AELITA: Uh- yeah.


But it’s one of those thing I still don’t remember.


I haven’t any idea when I was born.




JEREMIE: No problem.


All you have to do is make up a date, Aelita!


AELITA: Why don’t you choose one for me then?


JEREMIE: Okay.


AELITA: Well?


Go on.


JEREMIE: Uh-uhn- I’m not telling.
It’ll be a surprise.


ODD: Hey, are you guys coming or not?!


Hurry up before I fall asleep on this bridge!


ULRICH: Yeah, we’re coming-
No need to wake the whole town up!


ODD: Who’s the pretty present for, huh?
Who’s the pretty present for my little diggity dog?


ULRICH: Hey Odd, thanks again for Yumi.


You really saved me this time.


ODD: Ah, no sweat.


ULRICH: Pretty classy collar…


But don’t you think it’s a bit too much for a dog?
