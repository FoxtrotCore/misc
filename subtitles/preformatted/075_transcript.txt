75 - Hot Shower


JEREMIE: Okay then, I’m uploading the program over to you.


Now the Skid's sonar should be able to differentiate bio-signals


bio-signals from the rest of the computer code in the digital sea.


AELITA: {\i1}Okay Jeremie. Program received and activated.


ODD: {\i1}And you think that with this{\i0} we'll be able to find out where Xana is keeping


the spiritual essence of William prisoner?


AELITA: {\i1}Let's hope so…


{\i1}It's the best chance we have to bring him back into the real world.


ODD: {\i1}Ah{\i0}, the return of our tall handsome hero-


I'm sure Ulrich's gonna be thrilled {\i1}to have his old rival back{\i0}.


ULRICH: {\i1}Odd...
Sometimes you're really a bit too much.


ODD: Only sometimes ?


{\i1}Oh no, I guess I must be slipping!


JEREMIE: Speaking of Yumi, I wouldn't mind being in her shoes today.


ULRICH: Are you kidding?
Helping run the outdoor science lab with fifth graders


isn't exactly her idea of fun.


JEREMIE: Ah, come on.
I bet she's loving it!


MRS. HERTZ:
{\i1}To mark the exceptional event of the comet VG724's passage near Earth,


{\i1}We are going to build a giant mock-up
{\i1}of the solar system to plot its path


{\i1}and better understand its periodic extrasolar orbit.


{\i1}Beside me is a scale model of our sun as… you can see.


{\i1}What you are going to do now is create eight planets
{\i1}which orbit around it so break off into different teams


{\i1}With each team responsible for one planet and its orbit.


{\i1}Fifth-graders will make their planets to scale whereas
{\i1}Ninth-graders will have the responsibility-


JOHNNY: Uh, Yumi- I’d really like to be on your team.


YUMI: Sorry Johnny, that’s not up to me.
It’s up to Mrs. Hertz.


MRS: HERTZ: {\i1}Are there any questions?


JOHNNY: Could I be on Yumi’s team, huh ma’am?!


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


MRS. HERTZ: {\i1}Alright Johnny, but don’t let me catch you clowning around with Hiroki!


JOHNNY: This is really gonna be a lot of fun, huh?


DEFAULT: {\i1}The mass and velocity of the comet known as VG724
{\i1}are so great that striking the Earth would provoke--


{\i1}--an explosion equivalent to a thousand times the strength
{\i1}of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.


{\i1}Subseuqent earthquakes and tsunamis
{\i1}would destroy the world's major cities.


{\i1}Atmospheric debris would blot out the sun
{\i1}in a long night lasting two centuries.


{\i1}Consequently, this would spell mass extinction
{\i1}for flora and fauna- and the entire human race.


{\i1}Now, of course there's no risk of this happening
{\i1}since the comet will pass no closer than, um- well…


{\i1}two million kilometers from our planet.


{\i1}We also have been informed by highly confidential
{\i1}sources that the government operates--


{\i1}--a secret military satellite armed with laser cannons
{\i1}Sufficiently powerful to be able to alter the course


{\i1}Of any interstellar threat such as this.


AELITA: {\i1}The detection spectrum is honing in.


The sonar is picking up a faint trace of
digital DNA in the area.


It might be William, or even maybe…


ULRICH: {\i1}Your father?


{\i1}Well what are we waiting for?!
{\i1}Let’s go check it out!


AELITA: Okay.


MRS: HERTZ: {\i1}This is for you-


And you-


DEFAULT: (CHATTERING)


JOHNNY: Whoa!
Too cool, guess what!


We get to do planet Earth!


YUMI: Yeah great-
This is my lucky day.


HIROKI: Earth {\i1}and{\i0} the moon.


YUMI: {\i1}Yippee.


{\i1}And to think Jeremie wanted to take my place…


MRS. HERTZ: {\i1}And don’t forget-


{\i1}The sun here should be
{\i1}the center of your calculated orbits, right?


{\i1}And fifth-graders, make sure you note
{\i1}your planetary scale in relation to the sun.


{\i1}Need I remind all of you this exercise will be graded.


{\i1}Now get to work!


JIM: Just a second, Susane.


I have an important safety announcement to make.


{\i1}Now about the poles-
{\i1}I’d like to call your attention to an important technical aspect-


{\i1}They have two ends.


{\i1}One is pointy and sharp-
{\i1}That’s the one that you put into the ground.


{\i1}If you try to do it the other way, you might hurt yourself
{\i1}Pushing on the pointy end.


DEFAULT: (GIGGLING)


DEFAULT: Come on, you’d have to be an idiot not to figure that out!


JIM: Eh-


(CLEARS THROAT)


JEREMIE: Ugh, why now?


Why can’t we just go on an exploratory mission in peace for once?


Well Xana, what do you have in store for us this time?


DEFAULT: (NOTHING)[t]


JEREMIE: {\i1}Sorry Aelita,{\i0} but you're need back on Lyoko on the double.


{\i1}Activated tower.


AELITA: Got it, Jeremie.
I’m turning around.


DEFAULT: (CHATTERING)


HIROKI: Okay, I’m done!


What do you think of my planet Earth?


JOHNNY: Look Yumi!
The moon is yours for the asking!


YUMI: Yeah right.


Hiroki, doesn’t the Earth have another name?


HIROKI: {\i1}The Blue Planet{\i0}, yeah I know-


I was using a little imagination like if there was a Mars attack.


YUMI: And you, Johnny-
Do you really think anything can grow on the moon?


JOHNNY: Well no.


But I figured it would be more poetic with plants.


YUMI: {\i1}Both of you start over and fix it!


HIROKI: Forget it-
Imagination and poetry are wasted on her…


YUMI: Please-
{\i1}Send me a miracle to get me out of this…


Hello?


Yes Jeremie?


An activated tower?!


{\i1}Wow! Thank you Xana!


JEREMIE: Huh?


What are you talking about?


YUMI: Oh, nothing.


I’m on my way right now!


DEFAULT: {\i1}Some breaking news,


{\i1}It appears the comet VG724 has broken apart-


JEREMIE: What is going on around here?


DEFAULT: {\i1}-Following a shot from a satellite… um…


{\i1}Uh, for reasons yet unknown-


{\i1}Correction- international observatories have now confirmed
{\i1}That all’s well with the comet and it will simply crash oh uh…


{\i1}Uh- nowhere!


{\i1}As you know it will pass very far from Earth!


{\i1}And anyway, we could always obliterate it with military satellites.


{\i1}Which of course don’t exist!


{\i1}This is just a little April Fool joke from our producer.


{\i1}So that’s it!
{\i1}Farewell- I mean more news later!


(LAUGHTER)


JEREMIE: Oh no, it’s not April.


{\i1}Dos{\i0}, something is going haywire.


Let’s see, orbital observation program…


Comet VG724…


{\i1}Aelita{\i0}, I just figured out Xana’s attack.


Xana used a satellite to change the course of a comet!


It’s gonna create a meteor shower that will pour down on Earth!


AELITA: {\i1}What?!
{\i1}Are you sure?


JEREMIE: Well actually, according to my calculations-
Most of the meteorite should burn up completely


In the atmosphere.


On the other hand, there's a huge chunk coming behind it
That will crash directly into-


Oh no- {\i1}into the factory!{\i0}


AELITA: Jeremie, you have to get out of the computer lab right now!


JEREMIE: I can’t do that.


If the computer lab gets destroyed,
you guys will be stuck in the digital sea at Xana's mercy!


No, we’ve got to deactivate the tower.


ODD: {\i1}Relax Jeremie!
{\i1}We’ll do it in no time!


ULRICH: {\i1}Yeah, but that’s not gonna stop
the meteorite from falling…


JEREMIE: That’s true…


And that’s why I’m staying here
to launch a return to past before we're hit by it.


AELITA: Okay, full speed ahead.


JEREMIE: {\i1}You've got a hub bearing northwest of your position
{\i1}under the data bank shelf.


AELITA: {\i1}Got it.


Hub dead ahead.


YUMI: Jeremie?
Yeah- I’m almost there!


What?!


JEREMIE: {\i1}Yeah, a meteorite…
{\i1}And considering its mass,


{\i1}It’ll obliterate not only the factory,
But also the entire area including the academy.


The others are on their way back.
They’ll meet up with you on Lyoko.


Yumi, are you there?


YUMI: {\i1}Hiroki…


Sorry Jeremie, I’ll be right there but I…
I’ve got something important to do first.


JEREMIE: Yumi, this is not the time.
We need you immediately.


{\i1}Yumi?


Yumi!


ODD: Holy cow, what is that?


AELITA: A firewall!
That’s got to be a present from Xana!


I’ll get us out of here!


{\i1}It’s not working!


{\i1}Jeremie, we’ve got a problem.


JEREMIE: I see it, Aelita.
I’m already on it.


HIROKI: Hey, where’d you go?
Look I painted over it with blue!


Now look at this awful color!


YUMI: Hiroki!


I want you to go home right now!
Okay?


Take Johnny with you!


I’ll meet you there later!


HIROKI: What?!
But what about Mrs. Hertz class?


YUMI: Hiroki, you heard me!


HIRKOI: Hey, what’s the matter with you?


You got in a fight with Ulrich again, huh?


Jim: By the way, Susane-
How's it going with Pedro?


MRS. HERTZ: Oh really, Jim-
Not around the students!


YUMI: Mrs. Hertz!
We have to evacuate the academy!


MRS. HERTZ: What are you talking about, Yumi?


YUMI: I know this may sound crazy,
but a meteorite is going to hit right here


where we're standing!


JIM: Hold on now, Isayama.
I told you eating that raw fish was no good for you…


YUMI: No, I swear it's true!
I just found out from a-


a friend who works at the national observatory!


DEFAULT: (WHISTLING)


DEFAULT: Wow!


Hey look, did you see that?


JIM: Wow!
Great fireworks!


MRS. HERTZ: Jim…
We have to evacuate the academy!


JIM: Huh?


AELITA: The firewall’s energy is set up
Along a fairly basic algorithm.


All we have to do is crack it,
And we’ll be able to slip through a breach in security.


JEREMIE: Good idea.
Hey, I think I finally understand what Xana’s really up to.


ODD: Bravo, Einstein!


You finally realize that he wants to destroy the supercomputer
to keep us from coming in


and pulling the virtual carpet out from under him?


JEREMIE: Well obviously.


But this time, he picked the most perfect moment.


AELITA: Of course-


By destroying the supercomputer,
Xana will not only destroy Lyoko,


But more importantly our only way back into the real world.


But why would he want to trap us here?


JEREMIE: To get ahold of you, Aelita.
You’re the one Xana has wanted to capture


Since we recreated Lyoko.


It’s called killing two birds with one stone.


MR. DELMAS: Come now, Susane.
This is ridiculous!


Are you absolutely sure it couldn’t have been from something else-
Fireworks, for example?


JIM: That’s what I keep telling her,
But I think she overdid it with the mint tea.


MRS: HERTZ: I know what I saw Jean-Pierre-
It was a meteor shower!


We have to get the students to safety now!


MR. DELMAS: Hmm…


Fine, as a precaution,
I’m willing to go ahead and evacuate the academy,


But I don’t want any panic!


AELITA: {\i1}Got it!
I found the weak link in the algorithm!


{\i1}It’s as plain as day.


{\i1}The system overcompensates pressure,
{\i1}But it takes three milliseconds to reverse its polarity!


JEREMIE: Of course!


By synchronizing the initial pressure,
You can neutralize the sinusoidal distortion Aelita!


ODD: {\i1}Translation?!


AELITA: Rubberband system.


Hang on-


Standby for stopping the turboprop-


Ready-


And now!


JEREMIE: Nice one, Aelita!


Now hurry and get over to the hub!
We need you back on Lyoko ASAP!


AELITA: Roger.


Everyone okay?


ODD: My breakfast wants to come back up to say hello,
But otherwise, all is well.


JEREMIE: They’re never gonna get there in time…
Unless I…


Yeah, if only I can manage to regain control of that satellite-
Even for a minute, I might just get the meteorite


To change its course again!


Let’s see…


Defense Department…


Top-Secret Data…


Password…


Piece of cake!


JIM: Okay, fire drill everybody!


I want all of you to make your way
Calmly to the main gate!


DEFAULT: Ah, not again!


AELITA: {\i1}Hub in sight.


Thirty seconds to dive.


JEREMIE: Bingo!




Well, now I’m just gonna need a transmission relay
To link up to the satellite.


YUMI: Jeremie?


Yes, I’m still at school.
I’m really sorry, but I had to-


JEREMIE: Don’t worry, Yumi.
Plan B time.


In fact, I’m glad you haven’t left school yet.


Your laptop?


Okay, I’ll go to your room and get it!


Then what?


Uh, okay.


JOHNNY: Hey-


Where’s your sister going?


HIROKI: Only one way to find out…


JEREMIE: Do you read me, Aelita?


{\i1}I’m entering to coordinates for Lyoko.


AELITA: {\i1}Standby for broadband acceleration in
{\i1}Three, two, one, zero!


DEFAULT: (WHISTLING)


DEFAULT: (EXPLOSION)


JIM: Take cover!


(GRUNTS)


(LAUGHING)


Calm down!


Calm down right now!


YUMI: (PANTING)


Jeremie, we’re good!
I just picked up your laptop!


JEREMIE: Head for the roof of the science building,
And hook it to the antenna.


YUMI: I’m on it!


JEREMIE: And hurry up!


AELITA: Okay, Jeremie.
We’re back on Lyoko.


Where’s the activated tower?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Desert sector.


Quadrant fifty-seven, forty-two.


AELITA: Roger.


{\i1}There it is.


YUMI: Oh no…


(GRUNTING)


HIROKI: Security door versus Yumi’s ankle-
I’ll bet on the door.


YUMI: What do you two think you’re doing here?!


AELITA: {\i1}Here we go.


Teleport.


ULRICH: The tower’s only fifty meters away,
How much time do we have, Jeremie?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Enough-


{\i1}If you can get rid of your welcoming committee.


ODD: He ran away…


So why waste a laser arrow on a coward?


Go on, buddy.
He’s all yours.


ODD: All of a sudden,
That tower seems a lot further away…


HIROKI: Maybe you should just tell us
What you think {\i1}you’re{\i0} doing?


YUMI: I haven’t got time for you brats!
Go back outside!


(GRUNTING)


HIRKOI: We know how to open it…


(LAUGHS)


YUMI: Shut up, Hiroki!
I’m sick of hearing your lies!


HIROKI: But it’s true,
We can open any door.


YUMI: Well if you think you’re so good
Then be my guest!


HIROKI: Okay, but first you gotta tell us what you’re up to.


YUMI: Oh, what have I got to lose-


A meteorite is going to crash on the school
And if I don’t connect this computer to the roof antenna now,


Then Jeremie won’t be able to access the satellite-
That might change its course!


Understand?!


HIROKI: A meteorite?


Not bad…


Now tell us what’s really going on.


DEFAULT: (EXPLOSION)


HIROKI: Okay, okay-
Let’s go Johnny.


YUMI: Incredible-


ULRICH: Super sprint!


(GRUNTS)


ODD: Laser arrow!


ULRICH: It’s hot…


ODD: Yeah, well this is the desert!


AELITA: It doesn’t look good…
We’ll never get through.


ODD: You should never say never!


YUMI: Okay, Jeremie- I’m on the roof!
Now what do I do?


JEREMIE: Listen- try to find the antenna cable.


YUMI: Got it.


JEREMIE: Great.


Now cut as cleanly as you can and stick it into
the blue plug that’s on the back of my laptop.


Push as hard as you can.


We can’t strip the wire, {\i1}there’s not enough time.{\i0}


{\i1}It should work.


YUMI: Great, what am I gonna do without a knife?


Huh-


ODD: Nice one, princess!


A coward {\i1}and{\i0} a cheater?


Hey!


ULRICH: We’ve gotta change tactics.


ODD: Yeah.


YUMI: {\i1}Okay Jeremie- it’s in!


JEREMIE: Great job.


Now let the duel begin.


DEFAULT: (CRACKLING)


JEREMIE: How did that rat Xana get onto me?!


How’s it going over there, Ulrich?


ULRICH: Not so good…


Stay behind us Aelita!


If you get devirtualized,
We’ll never be able to deactivate the tower!


ODD: How could- anyone- be such a- {\i1}bad shot?!{\i0}


AELITA: Odd!


The tarantulas haven’t fired at me even once…


ODD: That’s because you’ve got a couple of great bodyguards.


JEREMIE: Too late…


YUMI: Get going you two!
Hurry up!


HIROKI: What about you?


YUMI: {\i1}I can’t let go of the cable!
{\i1}Beat it!


JEREMIE: I’ll never make it…
Xana is a flawless program, and I’m only human…


ULRICH: This time- it’s all over!


AELITA: No Ulrich-


ULRICH: What are you doing?


AELITA: I’m forcing Xana to make a choice.


WILLIAM: (GROWLS)


AELITA: Hurry Odd-
Devirtualize me.


ODD: Huh?
What, are you crazy?


AELITA: Do what I say.


JEREMIE: Odd, Aelita’s right.
It’s our only hope.


AELITA: (YELLS)


WILLIAM: (GROWLS)


ODD: What was that all about?


ULRICH: No idea…


AELITA: (GRUNTS)


To win, sometimes you have to know how to lose.


JEREMIE: You think Xana understands that?


DEFAULT: (EXPLOSION)


(WHISTLING)


(CRACKLING)


JOHNNY: Hey what… Wow.


DEFAULT: We’re saved!


YUMI: Great shot, Jeremie.
Real bull’s eye.


JEREMIE: {\i1}It wasn’t me.
That was Xana.


Looks like he gave up on his plan.


AELITA: Xana wanted to capture me more than
He wanted to destroy the supercomputer.


With me back on Earth,
He couldn’t do either of them.


HIROKI: Well Yumi,
Don’t the brats get a {\i1}thank you{\i0}?


YUMI: Thank you, brats.


You guys really helped me a lot this time.


HIROKI: Yeah, I’m not gonna let you forget that either.


YUMI: Oh give me a little break, huh?


(CLAPS)


JEREMIE: Return to the past, now.


So, how was your day?


YUMI: You won’t believe it,
But we got the highest grade!


And so, I promised Johnny I would keep his moon as a present.


I owe him at least that,
Even if he doesn’t remember anything.


AELITA: See, your brother’s not that bad after all.


YUMI: Yeah, he can be pretty handy when he wants to.


That’s why I’m worried.


ULRICH: Yeah, how come?


YUMI: Because now, I know it’s useless keeping the door locked to my room.
