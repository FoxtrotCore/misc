68 - Opening Act


YUMI: Hi everybody.


JEREMIE: Hi Yumi.


ULRICH: What's happening Yumi?


YUMI: You mean to tell me there's actually
little news in the Kadic news this time?


ODD: Don't tell me you haven't heard!


YUMI: Scoop of the year, bla bla bla,
Chris coming to Kadic, bla bla bla too amazing.


Chris? Chris who?


ULRICH: You're kidding.
Haven't you ever heard of the Subdigitals?


ODD: Chris is their drummer and he'll be at Kadic today.


YUMI: Hey you guys cool it, sounds like a phoney scoop.


JEREMIE: Yeah sure does,
just another one of Milly and Tamiya's dumb stories.


AELITA: Well it could be for real,
it seems that Chris's coming here to visit his uncle.


YUMI: You mean Chris has an uncle who works here?


AELITA: I wonder who that can be.


JEREMIE: You too Aelita? How can you believe that stuff?


YUMI: If it's true who do you think his uncle really is?


ULRICH: Fumet, Chardin, Mr. Delmas...
Not Mr. Delmas, Sissi could never be Chris's cousin.


AELITA: If she was she'd be shouting it out to anyone willing to listen to her.


ULRICH: What about Riley?


ODD: Huh? Michael Riley the custodian?
Right, well in that case why not Jim?


JIM: Well done Della Robbia, just as clumsy as ever.


ODD: Jim! What a coincidence, we were just talking about you.


JIM: About me?


ODD: Yeah, it seems that the Subdigitals drummer is coming to Kadic
to visit his uncle and we thought you'd be the first to know.


JIM: Me? No, what gave you an idea like that?


ODD: Oh, I almost forgot, how stupid of me.
That's not your style of music at all is it Jim?


You're more into like oldies, huh?


JIM: Yeah, but wait a second.
I also happen to like rock music and I love the Subdigitals.


Those guys are very talented artists, especially my nephew.
He's really great.


ODD: Hey, I was right! You're Chris's uncle!
I can't believe it.


JIM: Uh, I didn't say that, did I?


ODD: Uhuh,  You sure did Jim, that's what he said right?


JIM: Okay okay, little Chris is my nephew, but...!


ODD: That's what I call a sensational scoop!


JIM: Counting on you all not to tell anybody.


Especially you Della Robbia. I don't want this getting around.


ODD: I promise not to tell a living soul Jim.


DEFAULT: JIM


JIM: Hey, you're after the wrong guy!


I don't know any Chris, I’ve never heard of the guy you hear,
go away away I say!


MR. DELMAS: My dear Chris.


On behalf of the entire staff and student body of Kadic Academy,
I would like to issue a very warm welcome.


Chris, all yours.


CHRIS: Good morning everyone. And thank you all for this enthusiasm.
As I guess all of you know, I came here to visit my uncle.


But there's another reason as well,
the Subdigitals have decided to do a school tour to discover new talent.


And to develop that talent by giving you guys
a chance to be the opening act in our next concert.


And thanks to the kind authorization of your principal,
we’ve organized an audition for this afternoon in your gymnasium.


ODD: Now where did it go?
(DRAWER RUFFLING)


I’m positive I put it here.


ULRICH: Since when do you actually put any of your things away Odd?


ODD: Hahaha, very funny. You know, you guys could give me a hand.


YUMI: If you’d tell us what we’re looking for maybe we could help.

ODD: My CD-demo.

Oh, I absolutely have to play it for Chris.


YUMI: Well you did put it away, in Kiwi’s drawer.


ODD: Let’s see, oh thanks! My adorable little diggidy-dog.


Glory and fame are just around the corner,
I hope not too many kids show up.


ULRICH: You were saying?


AELITA: Ah! There you are!


(GIGGLING)


Jeremie, it’s you.


JEREMIE: Yea, I was thinking Aelita that since Delmas cancelled class today,
we could make some headway for the program for our new virtual ship.
z
AELITA: Well, I’d like to but…


JEREMIE: Oh no, come on don’t tell me you’re gonna waste your time going to that audition?


Imagine what XANA might be plotting on the Network even while we’re talking.


We’ve gotta find a way to travel there
and I was counting on you Aelita.


AELITA: Alright, I won’t go.


SISSI: Chris has got to choose my demo, he’s got a good ear for talent
and then I’ll be the greatest DJ star of all time.


ODD: The biggest DJ of all time huh?
What does DJ stand for? Dumb Jerk?


SISSI: Just cool it Odd! You’ll eat those words when you see me in a
stretch limo.


YUMI: Odd don’t worry. You’ll see, your mix will blow everyone away.


ULRICH: Yea as long as you don’t bust your eardrum.


ODD: Hey man! With fans like you who needs enemies.
Thanks for your support Ulrich.


CHRIS: Thank you uh, Matthias is that right?


DEFAULT: Uh, yeah.


CHRIS: Next!

SISSI: Hello I’m Sissi Delmas the daughter of Jean-Pierre Delmas the school principal.


I’m gonna play my best track for you, it’s called “I’m headed for the stars”!


CHRIS: Okay Sissi, hope it really takes off for you.


SISSI: You won’t believe your ears Chris.


CHRIS: Thank you Sissi.


ODD: Hey Sissi your stretch limo have a flat tire?


SISSI: Dork!


ODD: Uh, hello my name is Odd Della Robbia
and I think I’d better explain that my music is--


--a little experimental, actually well… Pretty different.
Well anyway, you’re going to love it.


JEREMIE: You see this is where I’m stumped. I still don’t understand the real nature of the transitional interface between Lyoko and the network, even though I’ve gone over and over the flux and--


--Hey Aelita? Are you listening?


AELITA: Huh? I’m-I’m sorry. Could you say that again?

JEREMIE: Nevermind. There might be a way.


I discovered that we could reconfigure the navigation parameters
in relative function to the frequency of the flux…


SFX: (ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC FADING OUT)
ODD: And there you go!


CHRIS: Um.. ahm.. Well, I…


ODD: Odd. Odd Della Robbia,
and what you’ve just heard is just little taste of what I can do.


I swear, I’ve got lots of other tracks you wanna hear them?


CHRIS: Some other time, maybe. Thanks a lot Odd.


ODD: I was good, wasn’t I?


YUMI: Well, you gave it your best shot. That’s the main thing.


ULRICH: One thing’s for sure, you said it was different and you weren’t lying.


JIM: Huh?


Well now kid, have you found the future star?


CHRIS: I’d rather not talk about it, Uncle Jim.


JEREMIE: What do you mean system error?
Ok, don’t blow your cool Jeremie.


We’ll just shift the polarity of the contact flux and uh-
Hand me those figures, huh?


Are you okay Aelita?


AELITA: Something wrong?


JEREMIE: It’s okay, I can finish up on my own.
If you wanna go, you can go.


AELITA: Are you- Are you sure?


JEREMIE: Yeah. I think I know what’s holding us up.


AELITA: Okay, I’m off then!
See you later!


CHRIS: It’s not that simple, it’s all part of this promotional operation.


If we don’t bring the record companies some new talent,
they’ll be down on me like a ton of bricks.


They’ve already made us change our name.


JIM: Don’t worry my boy, there’s gotta be a youngster
around here with a ton of talent!


MILLY: A few words for the Kadic news, Chris?


TAMIYA: Just one or two questions!


DEFAULT: Can I have an autograph, Chris?


AELITA: Oh no! I’m too late.


DEFAULT: When’s your next concert?


TAMIYA: Are you working on a new album?


DEFAULT: Sign my notebook please!


JIM: Calm down, he can’t answer your questions if you all talk at once.
Now let’s try one at a time.


DEFAULT: Me first! Me!


CHRIS: Hold on! Quiet down.
That’s fantastic it’s what I’ve been looking for all day, today.
SFX: (THUNDERING WIND)


CHRIS: Hey! I--


Oh no! I’m too late.


ODD: And you figure that compared to the rest of the candidates
I’d got a pretty good chance of getting picked?


Just thinking about being the opening act for the Subdigitals gives me the chills!


ULRICH: Odd, it’s not in the bag just yet.


MILLY: You guys want a scoop?


TAMIYA: Chris finally found the opening act he was looking for.


ODD: I knew it! Fame, fortune and glory are mine now!


MILLY: Forget about it, no-one who it is.


TAMIYA: Not even Chris.


ODD: What? But how can that be I didn’t stop repeating my name!


TAMIYA: No it happened after the auditions.
All he did was hear the music. He didn’t see the DJ.


ODD: I don’t believe it.


MILLY: He went to see the principal to see if he could find
this Cinderella, whoever he or she is.


Huh? What’s the matter with her?

ODD: Well, when you gotta go you gotta go, I guess.


JEREMIE: Oh no a XANA attack!


ULRICH: {\i1}Yeah Jeremie?


JEREMIE: The superscan has just picked up an activated tower.
We’ve got to get to the Factory fast.


ULRICH: {\i1}Okay but Aelita took off, and no-one knows where she went.


JEREMIE: Wait for me by the arches. I’ll stop by her room first.
See you in a few minutes.


AELITA: Chris!


I was looking for you, I wanted to give you this.

(SCREAMING)

MILLY: Chris! I bet you found out who the mystery DJ is, it’s a bu--


SFX: (GASP)


AELITA: {\i1}Hi, leave me a message.


YUMI: She’s not picking up.


JEREMIE: She’s not in her room either.


We were working together but she wasn’t concentrating.
She was more interested in showing her demo to Chris at the audition.


ULRICH: Oh now I understand why she took off like a rocket.


ODD: Do you think Aelita is the mystery DJ?


ULRICH: Kinda looks like it.


JEREMIE: You mind filling me in?


YUMI: Don’t worry, we’ll tell you on the way.


You two go and find her,
she must’ve gone to the principal’s office to see Chris.


Meet us at the Factory.


YUMI: You look like you’re in shock.
Did Sissi say something intelligent for once?


TAMIYA: Chris just kidnapped Aelita.


JEREMIE: What?


MILLY: Yeah, we saw him pass by with Aelita on his shoulder.
He was totally weird, like the mad killer in Executioner 2.


TAMIYA: Shouldn’t we call the police?


YUMI: Uh, I wouldn’t do that. That was just for the--
--the video, I mean the new Subdigitals video.


They’re doing this science fiction thing with robots invading the school.


JEREMIE: Right, we’ve gotta go now.
We got parts in the next scene they’re shooting.


ULRICH: Yes Jeremie. Huh?
Chris? Okay.


ODD: Hey look!


This has to be Aelita’s demo.


ULRICH: Odd look. Chris and Jim.


ODD: Outside?


ULRICH: She walked right into the lion’s den.


ODD: Aelita isn’t there. Chris must’ve locked her up somewhere.


ULRICH: That’s weird. He doesn’t look XANAfied, does he?


ODD: Only one way to find out.


JIM: Look kid, there’s nothing to worry about.
We’re gonna find your DJ.


ODD: Chris, check out this CD.
It’s just what you’re looking for.


JIM: Hey! Stern, Della Robbia, cut that out.


ULRICH: It’s important look, we’ve got the demo Chris’s been looking for.


CHRIS: What’s wrong? You want an autograph or what?


ODD: Uh sorry Chris but I uh-


JIM: Beat it you two, scram!


And I suggest you watch your step, I got my eye on you.
We’ll discuss this later.


ODD: I just don’t get it. If he didn’t kidnap Aelita then it must’ve been…


DEFAULT: A polymorphic spectre!


SFX: (ELECTRICITY WHIRRING)


JEREMIE: What’s going on? Aelita!


Too late.


AELITA: What am I doing here?


ULRICH: Yeah Jeremie, I’m listening.


JEREMIE: You can stop looking for Aelita, she’s on Lyoko.


ULRICH: We know, there’s a polymorphic spectre on the loose.


Okay, we’re on our way we’re at the secret passage.


JIM: Ha ha ha! You guys are as easy to track down
as carabao in the great north.


Stay where you are,
we have a few questions to ask you.


ULRICH: Sorry Jim but we don’t have time, we have to--


CHRIS: --Well we happen to be in a hurry too.
Are you the one who put this together?


ODD: Well yea, no. It’s a friend of mine, Aelita.


CHRIS: What’s her last name?


ULRICH: What’s the difference?
She’s in danger and that’s why we’re in a such a big hurry.


CHRIS: What do you mean in danger?
What’s this all about?


JIM: Take us to her immediately,
unless you’d rather settle this in the principal’s office.


ULRICH: Okay then. Come with us
but let me warn you about two things.


Try to avoid asking any questions and get ready for a workout.


JIM: Works for me Stern, there’s no work I like better than working out.


YUMI: Jeremie, I’m ready.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Okay here we go.


Scanner Yumi.
{\i1}Transfer Yumi.


{\i1}Virtualization.


AELITA: Energy field!


YUMI: You may be possessed by XANA
but you’re still a rookie on Lyoko William.


WILLIAM: Attack!


Follow her!


YUMI: Hey William!


Jeremie, where are Odd and Ulrich?
We’re gonna need some backup over here.


JEREMIE: They’re on their way.
Meanwhile try to get to the activated tower,


It’s bearing south of your position. I’ll bring you up a vehicle.

AELITA: What’s wrong ladies? Having a bad leg day?


YUMI: Jeremie? Where’s that vehicle, huh?


The old William was hard to get rid of
but this one is a lot worse.


ULRICH: Jeremie!


JIM: What is this place? A mad scientist hideout?


CHRIS: Who’s that guy over there? A stunt double or a clone?


ULRICH: A polymorphic spectre.


CHRIS: Yeah well, spectre or not he’s not getting my autograph.


JIM: Hey! Hands off my nephew, pal.


Now you’ll see what’s it like to mess with and old special forces agent.


Huh? Wha?


ODD: Hey, we really need you Einstein so wake up!


JEREMIE: Get to- Get to the scanner room Aelita she’s in trouble.
Hurry up!


CHRIS: Hey what’s going on around here?


ULRICH: I told you not to ask any questions.


AELITA: Jeremie.


ULRICH: All set Jeremie.


JERMIE: {\i1}Okay. First let me program an Overwing.


{\i1}Transfer Ulrich.{\i0}
Transfer Odd.


AELITA: Thanks Jeremie, that was a close one.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Move out Aelita, hurry up!


AELITA: Alright.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Virtualization.


ODD: Hey there you little crab-cakes, did you miss us?


ULRICH: Impact!


You can have the last one--
--supersprint!


ODD: Great! I love having seconds.


JIM: I’ll get rid of that imposter now! No-one does that to me
and gets away with it. Geronimo!


CHRIS: No uncle Jim!


ULRICH: If you’re trying to get a date with Yumi,
I’m not so sure that’s the right way.


JIM: You don’t have to be a math genius to know
that there’s one too many Jim’s here.


Reminds me of the time I fought against a hurricane windstorm
in Vegas back in ‘94.


The third round I just wo-


CHRIS: Oh I’m sorry, I-


JEREMIE: How are you guys doing? We’ve got our hands full here
and if this keeps up the Subdigitals are gonna need a new drummer.


ODD: We’re doing our best Einstein!


Okay, let’s get down to business!


Laser arrow!


WILLIAM: Manta!


ODD: Surprise!


SFX: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)


(ELECTRICAL CRACKLING)


(HUMMING CONT.)


AELITA: Tower deactivated.


ULRICH: Don’t worry William, I’ll fight you every step of the way.


WILLIAM: Supersmoke.


JIM: Belpois I want an explanation right now.
What is going on?


And what in the world is all this equipment for?


JEREMIE: I would but, I’m getting tired of explaining it to you Jimz
cause in ten seconds you won’t remember any of it anyway.


CHRIS: Not so fast, first tell me who Aelita is.


JEREMIE: Return to the past now.


ODD: I finally figured out what was wrong with my demo.


I didn’t push the second break with the series of scratches.
You’ll see, I’ll do a lot better next time.


JEREMIE: Well I guess in the end, XANA’s attack ended up giving us another free afternoon to work on our virtual ship. Huh Aelita?


JEREMIE: Come in!

CHRIS: Excuse me, I’m looking for Aelita Stones?


AELITA: Uh, that’s me, but-


CHRIS: I’m really glad to meet you Aelita,
I heard your demo and I think it’s really great.


Can we go over to the gym?
I’d like to hear it live.


AELITA: I’d like to, but I’m not sure I can.


JEREMIE: Go on, it’s an offer you can’t refuse.


AELITA: Okay then! Let’s go!


By the way how did you get a hold of my demo?


CHRIS: Oh, one of your friends gave it to me.
