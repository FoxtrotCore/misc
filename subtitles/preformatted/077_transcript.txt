77 - Lost At Sea


ODD: Hey there, Aelita. Einstein isn’t with you?


AELITA: Mh mh. I haven’t seen him yet today.


ULRICH: Speak of the devil, look who’s here.


JEREMIE: Hello everybody.


ODD: Let me guess,
you fell asleep in front of your computer again?


JEREMIE: Uh, yeah, how’d you know?


ODD: The imprint of your keyboard’s on your forehead.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


JEREMIE: I was up all night working on a program,
I came up with an idea for bringing William back.


HIROKI: Hey Ulrich.


Can I talk to you for a sec?


ULRICH: Uh, well if you really have to, yeah.


Go ahead, I’ll meet you inside.


HIROKI: Well uh, everybody says that girls really like you a lot.


ULRICH: That depends on the girl.


HIROKI: Well like my sister, for example.


ULRICH: Huh, beep! Wrong, try again.
Yumi and I are good friends, that’s all.


HIROKI: Yeah, well maybe that’s just what she told you.


But anyway, I didn’t want to talk about Yumi,
but about Milly.


ULRICH: Milly who?


HIROKI: Milly Solovieff, you know that tall red-headed girl
in seventh grade?


ULRICH: Oh, little Milly. Yeah, of course I know her. So?


HIROKI: Well actually, I kinda like her, but when I try to talk
to her I can’t think of anything to say.


ULRICH: Just talk to her about the things she likes, her interests.
You know, she’s got a passion for journalism.


HIROKI: Great idea!
Wouldn’t it be great if I could find her a scoop?


She’d be crazy about me if I did.


ULRICH: Uh, yeah, a scoop for the paper.
But, uh, just what kind of scoop?


HIROKI: Oh you can leave that to me, Ulrich.


JEREMIE: What did Hiroki want to talk to you about?


ULRICH: Oh, he wanted my advice. He’s crazy about Milly.


ODD: He is? Well isn’t that cute.


But isn’t the guy a little young for her?


AELITA: No he’s not, he’s just a little small for his age,
and what’s more he skipped a grade in school.


ODD: But he acts even younger than his age.


ULRICH: Hey Jeremy, tell us about this new idea of yours.


JEREMIE: Well okay.


Whenever a human being is virtualized,
he or she emits a binary residue,


which we can say manifests itself
as an emanation of his physical person,


resequenced into sort of digital format.


ULRICH: Yeah, in english?


AELITA: When you go to Lyoko, you leave a kind of digital trace.
Something like a scent.


URLICH: Couldn’t you have said that in the first place?


JEREMIE: Mm, no.


Anyway, I came up with a program based on William’s DNA sequence
that I recorded when he went to Lyoko for the first time.


If I can upload this onto the Skid’s sonar, we
can hunt for him on the network every time we go there.


And finally find out where William really is.


ODD: So what you’re saying is
the Skid will become a sniffer sub.


JEREMIE: That’s right, Odd. And since we don’t have class
this afternoon, I was going to suggest that we try it out.


YUMI: (GASPS) Hiroki, what do you think you’re doing?


Hey, give that back to me, right now!


ODD: You sure look far away, Ulrich.


ULRICH: It’s nothing, just thinking about something Hiroki said.


ODD: Oh yeah, what was that?


ULRICH: Nothing, forget it.


HIROKI: Oops! Sorry.


ODD: What’s wrong?
Does Sissi want to go out with him or something?


ULRICH: Hey! Yumi, hold on.


ODD: Whoa.


ULRICH: Is this yours, Odd?


ODD: Huh? You kidding me, a notebook
with a dark cover and a flower is not my style.


HIROKI: Hah, ye-


YUMI: Give it back right this second, you brat!


HIROKI: Aw, come on Sis, I was just kidding.


Look, here it is.


Well, it was here.


YUMI: What?


HIROKI: Well you’re gonna laugh, but I dropped it, I think.


YUMI: You’d better be kidding.


ULRICH: Huh?


ODD: Hey, that’s a pretty good shot of you?
Who’s your secret admirer, let me see.


It’s Yumi’s, right?


ULRICH: It’s her diary.
That’s why she was running after Hiroki.


ODD: If you ask me, this is a great chance
to see what she thinks of you.


ULRICH: Oh no, what’s written inside here is not my business.


And don’t forget that Yumi and I
are just good friends, that’s all.


ODD: Are you sure?


ULRICH: Well…


Actually I’m not sure at all.


ODD: Hi Yumi.


ULRICH: Hey Yumi, what is it? You look angry.


YUMI: Oh, my stupid brother.


He stole…


something important to me, and he lost it.


ULRICH: Look Yumi, I uh-


JEREMIE: Okay, I got it.
I upgraded the Skid’s sonar, we’re all set.


YUMI: All set for what?


JEREMIE: Oh right, you don’t know yet. I’ll tell you all about it.
I might have found a way to bring back William.


YUMI: Oh, cool.


ULRICH: Uh, Yumi-


HIROKI: Yumi.


I’ve been looking for you.


I wanted to apologize for this morning,
I had no right to take your diary.


YUMI: Did you find it?


HIROKI: No, but I looked everywhere, I swear.


YUMI: Well until you find it,
you can consider yourself an only child.


AELITA: What happened?


ODD: Oh nothing. Some diary straits.


We’ll tell you about it.


Ulrich, can I see you for a minute?


AELITA: Well, so what do we do now?


JEREMIE: We go to lunch.


ODD: So what’s the deal?
I thought you were gonna return the diary?


ULRICH: Well you saw how crushed Hiroki was.


If I’m the one who gives the diary back,
Yumi will still be angry with him.


ODD: Yeah, so?


ULRICH: So what if we fix it up so that Hiroki finds the diary
and gives it to Yumi himself?


That’s two birds with one stone. She gets her diary back
and he gets his sister back. Pretty good idea, huh?


ODD: Yeah, great, but how do you plan to do it?


ULRICH: Hide the diary under a pile of leaves in the park,
near the garden shed. I’ll take care of Hiroki.


ODD: Okay, but give me a few minutes.


I’ve got to go get Kiwi first,
I forgot to walk him this morning.


ULRICH: Deal.


HIROKI: I totally messed that up, Ulrich.


ULRICH: Relax Hiroki, Yumi will calm down and forgive you.
Especially when she gets her diary back.


HIROKI: I know, but I’ve looked everywhere for it.


I even retraced my steps back to here, nothing.
I don’t know what to do.


ULRICH: Oh, by the way, this morning I thought I saw Mr. Riley
raking up some dead leaves on the park grounds.


HIROKI: So what? He’s the groundskeeper, that’s his job.


ULRICH: What if he raked up the diary at the same time?


HIROKI: Well that’s dumb, why would he do that?


ULRICH: He might have raked it up by accident.


HIROKI: Hey, the diary could be under a bunch of leaves!
Let’s go check!


ULRICH: Wait up, Hiroki!


Well, find anything?


HIROKI: No, nothing.


ULRICH: Keep looking.


Which one did you put it in?


ODD: Hiroki will find it soon enough, you’ll see.


Kiwi, there you are.
Where were you my little diggity dog? Get in!


HIROKI: I got it!


Huh?


YUMI: You mind telling me what you’re doing?


(GASPS)


I’ll never forgive you for this Hiroki.


ODD: Don’t look at me like that,
it was all there when I hid it.


JEREMIE: Get to the scanner room.
I’ll start up the virtualization process.


All set? I’ll launch the procedure.


{\i1}For once, it won’t be ladies first.


Transfer, Ulrich.


Transfer, Odd.


{\i1}Scanner, Ulrich.


{\i1}Scanner, Odd.


Virtualization.


ODD: Yumi’s in a foul mood.


You’d better tell her the truth about her diary.


ULRICH: And how do you think she’ll react when she finds out
that you were the one who hid it?


ODD: Hey, this was your idea Casa Nova.


YUMI: Let’s go.


JEREMIE: Ladies and gentlemen, your elevator’s waiting.


{\i1}Everyone get on a teleport spot.


Energize.


Everyone ready?


Standby for liftoff, releasing supports now.


AELITA: {\i1}Vertical propulsion operational.


Liftoff.


JEREMIE: Get ready to dive into the digital sea.


Holoweb system connected.


AELITA: {\i1}We’ve left Lyoko, Jeremie.


Rotation.


{\i1}Turbo propeller launched.


JEREMIE: I’m running the program.
Standby to receive initial coordinates.


AELITA: {\i1}Roger.


JEREMIE: Oh no!


AELITA: What’s going on?


ODD: A problem, Princess?


AELITA: We’ve got a system error. I think the Skid has a malfunction
in part of its sensory capacity.


JEREMIE: Yes, I see it, Aelita.
It’s my program that bugged up the Skid’s sonar.


The mission’s too dangerous without sonar,
gotta end it now.


AELITA: {\i1}Roger, returning to dry dock.


ODD: Okay, next mission, diving into my pillow
and burying myself under the covers.


{\i1}Objective, a good night’s sleep to clear my head.


JEREMIE: Sorry, but you’re gonna have to postpone your nap, Odd.


I’ve got three Kongres heading straight for the Skid.


AELIAT: Navskids away.


YUMI: (GASPS)


Take this, fish-face.


ODD: Not bad. Yumi’s pretty effective when she’s mad.


I’ve got one on my tail.


{\i1}Oh, it’s sticking to me like glue.


ULRICH: {\i1}Yeah, bullseye.


ODD: {\i1}Nice one, good buddy.


ULRICH: Wanna team up for the last one?


ODD: {\i1}Yeah, let’s do it.


DEFAULT: {\i1}Fire!


ODD: {\i1}Yahoo!


JEREMIE: Mh hm. Nice job, guys. Time to come home now.


AELITA: Navskids in.


AELITA: Hey, where’s Yumi?


JEREMIE: Huh?


I don’t get it. I don’t have any trace of her.


I’ve lost her.


AELITA: She must have gotten hit by a Kongre.


ULRICH: But that’s impossible.


ODD: Einstein, you think she might have been virtualized for good?


JEREMIE: No, I don’t think so.


The data recording from the fight
doesn’t show any sign of her having been eliminated.


AELITA: {\i1}That means she’s still somewhere on board her Navskid,
somewhere in the middle of the digital sea.


JEREMIE: Right, but the Skid is in no condition to find her.
You guys have to come back in for me to run a repair program.


ULRICH: What? No way!


We can’t just leave her behind.


AELITA: Ulrich, no one’s leaving anyone,
but all of us run the risk--


--{\i1}of being virtualized forever
with the Skid’s systems down.


ULRICH: Yeah, you’re right. We’d better go.


How long will it take you to fix it?


JEREMIE: Reprogramming the sonar is linked to balancing
the bipolarity of flux on the one hand, on the other-


ULRICH: Just tell us when we can go back, okay.


JEREMIE: Soon, as long as you let me concentrate.


AELITA: Don’t worry, Ulrich, I’ll help him.


I’ll call you as soon as we know.


ULRICH: (SIGHS)


YUMI: {\i1}Can anybody hear me? This is Yumi.


I don’t know where I am.


I’m in trouble, almost out of power.


{\i1}Can you hear me? Answer me. Somebody please answer me!


ULRICH: What a nightmare.


ODD: Relax, you heard Einstein. She isn’t gone from the network.
We’ll bring Yumi back, don’t worry.


SFX: (BARKING)


ODD: Hey, what have you got there, Kiwi?


Ulrich, this is Yumi’s diary!


ULRICH: What?


ODD: I get it, Kiwi saw me bury it, but he thought it was a game,
so I guess he dug it up and buried it here,


right where we’re sitting now.


ULRICH: That’s great, we found her diary, but now we lost Yumi.


YUMI: {\i1}Jeremie?


Aelita?


Can you hear me? This is Yumi. I’m almost out of power.


It’s cold here, and I feel all alone.


(GASPS)


Okay Yumi, you’ve got only one torpedo left,
so don’t waste it.


Oh no, not enough power.


{\i1}I’m not done yet.


{\i1}If I reduce power in my shield, I should have enough.


Yes!


{\i1}Okay, you and me.


{\i1}Fire!


JEREMIE: Huh?


AELITA: What was that?


JEREMIE: An explosion. A Navskid torpedo.


AELITA: Yumi!


ULRICH: Yes, Aelita?


Huh? Okay, we’re on our way.


They found Yumi.


Odd?


ODD: Well?


YUMI: I wanna go home.


HIROKI: Yumi, who am I gonna play with if you go away?


YUMI: No Hiroki, foot becomes feet in the plural.


HIROKI: How do you know all that, Sis?


MRS. ISHYAMA: Oh what are children up to this time?


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


HIROKI: Well, how long?


YUMI: Oh, at least ten minutes.


HIROKI: Wow!


YUMI: Hiroki.


HIROKI: I had no right to take your diary.


YUMI: Until you find it, you can consider yourself an only child.


I’ll never forgive you, Hiroki.


(GASPS)


JEREMIE: Come on, come on.


Yumi sent us a message, guys.


ODD: Great, we’ll go and get her.


JEREMIE: I have to finish the calculations first.


I’ve isolated the area, but it’ll be impossible to find
her exact location before I fix the Skid’s sonar.


ULRICH: But if she fired her torpedo, that means she’s in a jam.


AELITA: I transposed the data from the explosion into the holoweb
to get her position via triangulation.


JEREMIE: There she is!


She must have gotten sucked into a hub.
That’s why we lost all trace of her.


But the sonar is still down, guys.


So going under right now is gonna be a big risk.


ODD: Hm, I’ll go.


ULRICH: Count me in.


AELITA: Well what are we all waiting for?


{\i1}There’s a hub dead ahead.


JEREMIE: {\i1}I read you, Aelita.


I’m entering the coordinates
from where Yumi fired her torpedo.


AELITA: {\i1}Aspiration into hyper fluid in three seconds.


{\i1}Hang on tight.


YUMI: It’s all over. What’s he waiting for?


WILLIAM: Fire.


YUMI: (GASPS)


AELITA: {\i1}So Yumi…


Thought you’d wander off
without telling us where you were?


YUMI: It took you long enough to get here!


ODD: I wouldn’t mind a little fish soup.


Guess I’d better cook it though, first.


{\i1}Ulrich, behind you!


{\i1}Can’t leave you alone for a minute, huh, Ulrich?


ULRICH: Okay, he’s behind Odd.


{\i1}Big mistake, William.{\i0} Fire.


{\i1}Mission accomplished, Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Hey, great job. Now anchor yourself to the Skid
and head back in. Ah, they’re all coming home.


AELITA: Not everybody. But one day, we’ll bring you back William.


YUMI: (GASPS)


HIROKI: Yumi?


I wanted you to know just how sorry I am for what I did.


YUMI: Thanks for bringing it back.


HIROKI: Huh?


YUMI: You know, I understand now that what we have
is more important than some old diary. I forgive you.


HIROKI: Are you in love, or what?


YUMI: Get out of here.
