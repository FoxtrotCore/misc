85 - Kadic Bombshell


MS. KENNINGSTON: And at the end of the play, Juliet drinks a potion which makes her appear to be dead.


Romeo, thinking he’s lost his young bride poisons himself,
and when Juliet wakes and sees the lifeless Romeo,


she drives a dagger through her heart.


SISSI: That is so beautiful.


ODD: That is so idiotic.


SFX: (BELL RINGING)


MS. KENNINGSTON: Don’t forget to review the balcony scene for next week.
See you on Monday.


AELITA: What didn’t you like about it, Odd?
It’s a wonderful love story, isn’t it?


ODD: That’s just it, Aelita, it’s a story.
Killing yourself for love? That’s dumb.


JEREMIE: That’s because you haven’t met a girl
who loves you enough to die for you.


ODD: Listen, if you ask me, nobody would die for love.
Would you be ready to die for Yumi, Ulrich?


ULRICH: Better believe it. Well- I’m- That is…


YUMI: Hi, what are you guys talking about?


ODD: Oh, about tragedy and true love, and Ulrich was just saying-


ULRICH: That it’s totally idiotic.


YUMI: Hm?


JEREMIE: Hey, Aelita, I think I figured out a way
for improving source logarithms and I could use your help.


AELITA: That sounds great, but first, let’s have lunch.


(LAUGHING)


ULRICH: Do you think Aelita and Jeremie
would be ready to die for each other?


ODD: For love, I don’t know. They might die of boredom though.


YUMI: Hey, look, what’s that all about?


NICHOLAS: Hey, come on, what’s your name?


JUILIEN: How long are you here for?


BASTIEN: Can you speak English?


DEFAULT: I’d love to show you around.


DEFAULT: (CLAMORING)


YUMI: Wow, give me a break. Who is she?


MILLY: Sissi’s overseas penpal. She’s visiting for four days.
Her name is Brynja (STUTTERING) whatever.


TAMIYA: Brynja Heringsdötir, and she’s from Iceland.


MILLY: And Sissi’s just eating it up.
Thanks to Brynja, she’s getting lots of attention.


YUMI: Yeah, only this time, the boys aren’t interested in her.


SISSI: Okay, the show’s over. I’ll take Brynja to her room.


YUMI: Time to wake up, you two.


ODD: I’m awake.


ULRICH: What’d you say?


AELITA: Are you saying then that your program
lets you modify gamma waves?


JEREMIE: Yeah, that’s right, which means
we can have a much faster virtualization and more… wow.


ULRICH: What?


ODD: Hm?


SISSI: Hey, let me through, huh? Huh?


Hmph.


BRYNJA: Thank you.


MATTHIAS: Oh, she said “thank you” to me!


YUMI: I wonder what the boys see in that string bean.


AELITA: Look at the girls, they’re all chasing after her
to find out her beauty secrets.


SISSI: I’d like to sit down if you don’t mind.
Let me through, will you?


Hmph!


HERB: Sorry, Sissi, this seat is taken.


I’m holding onto it because Brynja promised
that she would sit with me during dessert.


SISSI: Huh?


ODD: (SIGHS) Well this weekend is R and R for me,
rest and recuperation, yes sir.


YUMI: You’re not going to the pool tomorrow with Miss Iceland?
Seems everyone’s going.


ODD: No, I’ve got better things to do,
like hours and hours of sleep.


Oh, sorry.


SISSI: Watch where you’re going, huh, creepo?


ODD: Sissi, one of these days, someone is gonna-


(GIGGLES)


BRYNJA: Odd is alright.


ODD: I tell you, she’s something else.
She’s gorgeous and slim, and her hair’s like gold!


And did you see those deep, clear, green eyes?
Absolutely incredible.


Wow. And did you get a look at that beautiful soft skin she has?


Maybe it’s not just beautiful,
beautiful’s not the word. (STAMMERING)


AELITA: You mean ugly?


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


YUMI: You talk about her as if she’s
the eighth wonder of the world.


ULRICH: (GROANS)


ODD: That’s right. Those are the words I was looking for.
Brynja is the eighth wonder of the world.


ULRICH: Odd, are you sure you don’t have a problem with-


JEREMIE: A slightly overheated brain?


ULRICH: Yeah, that’s what I meant.


ODD: It’s not my fault I caught Brynja’s eye
and you didn’t.


ULRICH: She really has fried your brain,
can’t you see that she comes on strong to everyone?


ODD: You know something? You’re just jealous, good buddy.


BRYNJA: Oh, there you are, Odd. Are those your friends?
I’d like to meet them.


ODD: Why sure, Brynja. Aelita, Yumi…


YUMI: Hello.


AELITA: Brynja.


ODD: ...Ulrich, and Jeremie.


BRYNJA: Are you the one who’s name is Einstein?
You look very intelligent.


JEREMIE: Yeah?


BRYNJA: Ulrich, you’re the one who likes to martial arts?
Perhaps you could give me a demonstration?


ULRICH: (STAMMERING) Okay.


BRYNJA: It is nice to get to know all of you.
Shall we go for a walk, Odd-askir[ad]?


ODD: Askir, that means sweetheart! (LAUGHS)


ULRICH: I really wonder what she sees in that shrimp.


JEREMIE: Yeah, you’re right. Brynja needs somebody
a little more intellectually developed.


AELITA: Do you guys realize you’re talking about your friend?
Jealous, both of you. I don’t believe it.


Talk about fried brains, Jeremie, you take the cake.


JEREMIE: You’re wrong, Aelita. I was just
working out the statistical probability


of a girl as pretty and charming as Brynja
falling in love with a guy like Odd.


YUMI: Look at you, Ulrich. Ever since that blonde ice cube--
--showed up here, you’ve turned into a doormat.


ULRICH: Me? I have not. Anyway, I don’t know why you should care.
Afterall, “we’re just good friends, that’s all”.


YUMI: (SIGHS)


ULRICH: What is it with girls this year?


JEREMIE: They’re right, you know.


ULRICH: Hm?


JEREMIE: That Brynja’s really started messing with our heads.


ODD: (HUMMING)


Huh? Did I miss an episode?


YUMI: Odd, we have to talk seriously.


ULRICH: It’s true, ever since you started going out with Brynja
there’s been a lot of friction in our group. And-


JEREMIE: And that’s not very good for our mission.
Your girlfriend is coming between us and-


AELITA: And we think the best thing for you to do
is to break up with Juliet now, Romeo.


ODD: You actually want me to stop seeing Brynja
just because you guys can’t get along?


It’s not her fault or mine either.
The problem is you and your jealousy!


YUMI: Odd, wait, it’s a big problem.


ODD: Maybe for you, but not for me.
In fact, I have a date with your problem. So ciao.


DEFAULT: (SIGHING)


BRYNJA: You look a little upset. If you don’t want to go out…


ODD: Sure I do, it’s just that my friends are acting so lame.


Come on, let’s go.


BRYNJA: (SIGHS)


JEREMIE: The program’ll run all night.
We’ll have to wait ‘til tomorrow.


AELITA: Still thinking about Odd?


JEREMIE: I was wondering if our little gang will survive
this eighth wonder of the world.


AELITA: Honestly, I wouldn’t worry.
Odd’s romances last an average of two days.


JEREMIE: I don’t know,
I think that girl has turned our Casanova into a Romeo.


BRYNJA: You have such a sad face all night.
You’re not happy to be with me?


ODD: Sure I am, I was just thinking about the fight
I had with my buddies.


BRYNJA: Don’t worry, sometimes you make friends,
sometimes you lose them. You make new ones.


ODD: Oh, they’re not just any old pals. They’re real friends.
And real friends count a lot more for me, Brynja.


BRYNJA: That is true, but your “real friends” have made you
very sad. Now that we are together you don’t need them.


ODD: Hm? No no, it’s really different with them.
You wouldn’t understand.


BRYNJA: Well then explain it to me. What is the matter?
Don’t you trust me, Odd?


ODD: Uh… Well you see,
we’re- we’re kinda like an army… of warriors.


BRYNJA: Warriors? What do you mean?


ODD: Oh nothing. Forget I ever said it.


BRYNJA: I thought that you trusted me. But you-


ODD: Brynja wait!


Okay, let me show you something.
Maybe you’ll see why my friends are so special.


But you’ve got to swear to keep it a secret.


Here we are. Tada!


BRYNJA: (GASPS)


Oh, this is incredible. What is this place?


ODD: Uh, it’s kinda complicated, I’m not sure I understand
it all. They’re pretty top secret scientific experiments.


Ultra secret, phenomena, digital kind of stuff.


BRYNJA: Wow.


ODD: Hm?


No, Brynja don’t touch anything!


BRYNJA: Alright, Odd, I’m not an idiot.


ODD: But the supercomputer was doing something. What did you do?


BRYNJA: Me? Nothing at all, I hardly touched the keyboard.


ODD: Okay, I think we better go now.


BRYNJA: But I haven’t seen anything yet.


ODD: Let’s go, please, Bryjna.


BRYNJA: (SIGHS)


ODD: (NERVOUS LAUGHING)


SFX: (COMPUTER BEEPING)


JEREMIE: Huh? What’s going…


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


ULRICH: What is it?


JEREMIE: You’ve got to get up. Activated tower in sector…


That’s weird, there isn’t any activated tower.
Okay, Ulrich, you can go back to sleep, false alarm.


I don’t get it.


ULRICH: (SIGHS)


SFX: (SEAGULLS CALLING)


AELITA: You sure you heard the alarm?


JEREMIE: Sure, I’m sure,
and I don’t think my computer’s gone paranoid.


So that’s why we’ve got to hurry
and find out what’s going on.


Still no activated tower.


Now let me check the log.


Bingo, there’s a system alert alright, but not
from this morning. It was at 1236 last night. Interesting.


Huh?


This is getting weirder every second.


SFX: (BEEPING)


JEREMIE: Look, the supercomputer says that
there’s an activated tower in the desert sector,


but in terms of digital activity, nothing’s going on.


AELITA: What’s the cause of these false alarms?
You think it’s a virus?


JEREMIE: Could have been a problem with the program
that we launched last night…


But I don’t get it, I checked everything out.


Here are my calculations. Oh no!


AELITA: What is it? What’s wrong?


JEREMIE: The program has been modified.


Some sort of parasitic, foreign data
was entered into the supercomputer.


Someone came here last night for sure.


AELITA: Hm.


Uh oh. Looks like Odd made a big fat mistake.


JEREMIE: No, I think his mistake is more like skinny and blonde.


ODD: {\i1}No, Brynja, don’t touch anything!


JEREMIE: Only you’re too late, Odd.


AELITA: Well no need to look any further, Jeremie.
Odd gave away our secret.


JEREMIE: It was Brynja. By touching the keyboard, she modified--
--my program, and that’s what messed up the supercomputer.


AELITA: Can you fix it, Jeremie?


JEREMIE: Yeah, but the problem is that it might take a little while,
and of course during that time, Xana could-


SFX: (COMPUTER BEEPING)


JEREMIE: Activated tower! Though it could be another false alarm.


AELITA: Yes, but we can’t be sure. Send me to Lyoko.


JEREMIE: Uh uh, too risky.


AELITA: But not knowing what Xana could be up to is even riskier.
You need someone there like before we had the superscan.


JEREMIE: Yeah, you’re probably right. Get in.


{\i1}The activated tower
should be in the northwest part of forest sector.


AELITA: Gotcha!


JEREMIE: {\i1}Transfer Aelita.


Scanner Aelita.


Virtualization.


AELITA: Jeremie? You made a mistake, you sent me to the ice sector.


JEREMIE: No, I didn’t make a mistake,
I virtualized you in the forest sector.


Hoo, you[ae] really have a huge problem.


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


ULRICH: Jeremie, what’s up?


He must be with his Icelandic icicle.


Huh?


Be right there.


Odd took the eighth wonder of the world to the factory
and guess what? She tweaked the supercomputer.


Sissi, you haven’t seen Odd around, have you?


SISSI: I sure have. He’s in the park with my penpal.


JEREMIE: Where are you, Aelita?


AELITA: I don’t feel any pulsations,
I don’t think there’s a problem.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Okay then, I’m gonna bring you back in right now.
I don’t like your being all alone in Lyoko.


{\i1}Materialization Aelita.


AELITA: (GRUNTS)


Oh no, Jeremie, another major problem.
Believe it or not, I’m in the mountain sector.


And I’m not alone either.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Okay, Aelita, I’ll warn the others.


ULRICH: Odd!


ODD: Oh, hi, guys.


ULRICH: How was the movie last night? Which one was it?


ODD: Uh, Jurassic Experiment.


YUMI: Oh yeah? You sure it wasn’t two rats in the factory?


ODD: Uh, no, what makes you say that?


YUMI: Because Jeremie’s got the whole film on video.


The actors of the spitting image of you two love birds.
Anything to say for yourself?


ODD: Hey, listen, it’s not what you think,
I was gonna tell you about it.


YUMI: What’s in that head of yours, sawdust?
The supercomputer is on the blink.


Odd, you have just betrayed your way out of our group.


BRYNJA: But what is the problem? Yes we visited your mysterious--
--laboratory, but that’s not the end of the world.


YUMI: For your information, it could be the end of the world.


BRYNJA: I’ve had enough of these stories. I’m going to--
--the swimming pool. Well, Odd, are you coming or not?


ODD: I, um, I’m really sorry.


DEFAULT: (GASPS)


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


ULRICH: Jeremie?


Things could be better.


Huh? Well why did you send her out alone?


Be right there.


What’s the matter today? I think everyone’s gone crazy.


YUMI: Hm.


JEREMIE: Hang in there, Aelita. Ulrich and Yumi are on the way.


I’ll be finished fixing the supercomputer really soon,
just a couple of minutes.


AELITA: A couple of minutes?
Survival out here is a matter of a few microseconds.


Energy field!


WILLIAM: Cease fire.


Aelita, at last! Just the two of us!


JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita, watch out!


WILLIAM: Huh?


YUMI: {\i1}We’re here, Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Okay, you’re going in right now.
Aelita’s in big trouble in the mountain sector.


ULRICH: Just a second, Einstein. How do you plan on sending us there
if the supercomputer’s all messed up?


JEREMIE: {\i1}No idea, I’m trying to fix it, but we have to risk it.
If not, Aelita will be at the mercy of William.


ULRICH: Another crazy idea.


It gets better and better.


JEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.


Transfer Yumi.


{\i1}Scanner Ulrich.


Scanner Yumi.


Virtualization.


ULRICH: Hey, didn’t you say the mountain sector?
Speaking of bright ideas, Einstein.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Sorry, guys.


YUMI: Chill, Ulrich, okay? It’s not Jeremie’s fault.


Don’t forget, we could have wound up
in the digital sea, too.


JEREMIE: I can always try to bring you back in
and then send you to the right sector.


YUMI: {\i1}No, we can’t take the chance. We’ll find our own way.
Just point us in the right direction.


JEREMIE: {\i}Okay, the way tower is due south
from your present position.


ULRICH: Jeremie, we’re almost at the way tower.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Roger.


Listen, Aelita,
I’m almost through fixing the supercomputer. You okay?


AELITA: No, I’m not okay at all.


(GRUNTS)


(GASPS)


WILLIAM: Xana’s finally gonna have your company for good. (LAUGHS)


ULRICH: Hey, William, when are you gonna learn
that we never abandon our friends?


Super sprint!


DEFAULT: (CHEERING)


NICHOLAS: What do you say we go for a swim together later?


JULIEN: Do they have beaches in Iceland?


NICHOLAS: Hey, would you like to have a fantastic,
breathtaking experience-


DEFAULT: Shut up, Poliakoff.


NICHOLAS: In the moonlight together?


JEREMIE: Hey, Ulrich, Yumi, go real easy, okay? If you guys get
devirtualized before I can fix the program,


I’m not sure that I can bring you back to Earth again.


YUMI: And you’re telling us this now?


ULRICH: Thanks a lot, what’s the bad news?


WILLIAM: How could I possibly ask for more?
I’m gonna get three birds with one sword.


ULRICH: We’ll see about that.


WILLIAM: It’s been seen to.


ODD: Uh, could you use my help?


JEREMIE: Odd, you’re not exactly welcome around here.
I’m sorry, but I have no time to chat with you.


ODD: Well that’s great, then let’s not waste any time
and virtualize me right away, our friends must need help.


JEREMIE: Okay, but with the supercomputer down,
you could be virtualized anywhere at all.


ODD: That’s my problem.


YUMI: Ulrich, no!


WILLIAM: You’re next!


JEREMIE: It’s the moment of truth, I guess.


Yeah!


Transfer Odd.


{\i1}Virtualization.


AELITA: Odd!


ODD: You think I’m afraid of that popsicle stick?


Aelita!


Whew!


Well, I know just what you’re gonna say.


I betrayed you and I’m a total lame-o,
and I should be kicked out of the group.


And you’re right, too, guys. I should never have shown
the supercomputer to Brynja. It’s unforgivable!


JEREMIE: Well no, you simply forgot that
inside that head of yours there happens to be a brain.


ULRICH: You’re not the only one who was lame,
we were just too jealous of you.


YUMI: Yeah, we all went a bit too far because of Brynja.


AELITA: Well, I forgive you, Odd. I mean, you saved me from William.


ODD: Well, still friends?


ULRICH: Yeah, still friends.


ODD: There is a way to fix the mess I made.
A little return to the past, hm?


JEREMIE: Oh, that won’t be necessary, I don’t think.


ODD: Hm?


DEFAULT: Goodbye, Brynja!


Have a great trip!


Yeah, bon voyage!


ODD: Can you believe that?
She completely forgot to say goodbye to me.


JEREMIE: Well now do you see why I’m not worried
about the supercomputer, Odd?


ODD: Who cares about her anyway.
There’s no shortage of girls around here.


ULRICH: Hey, Sissi, I thought that Brynja
was gonna stay here for four days.


SISSI: Well let’s just say I convinced my father
to send her out of town to my cousin’s place.


She wanted to see the countryside, so why not?


ODD: I guess for you that’s a real relief, ‘cause
now that Brynja’s gone, she can’t steal the show.


SISSI: You may not believe it, Odd, but it was really a pleasure.


You know I sometimes envy you two.


DEFAULT: Hm?


SISSI: Because being surrounded by guys all the time
could never happen to you.


DEFAULT: Hm.


ODD: Oh, now, now that’s the Sissi we all love!
How could I have flipped over Brynja?


SISSI: Get away from me, creepo!


ODD: Sissi! Sissi, wait, wherefore art thou, Juliet?


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


ULRICH: Uh oh, Odd’s gone bananas again! We better watch out guys!
