65 - Final Round


YUMI: You swear not to give away the secret?


WILLIAM: I swear it.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Good answer William.
Now for the final step, the scanner.


We’re going to record a virtual image of you in the supercomputer.
{\i1}After that, you’ll be immune to the returns to the past.


{\i1}That’ll really make you part of the group.


ULRICH: Well you ready?
You scared?


WILLIAM: Me, no why?
What about you, were you scared the first time?


ULRICH: No?


ODD: Oh yeah right.


ULRICH: I’m telling you I wasn’t scared.


ODD: Oh, sorry.
I guess I mixed you up with another Ulrich Stern.


YUMI: Hey you can still change your mind.


WILLIAM: Are you kidding?


JEREMIE: Scanner William.


Welcome to the club William.


ODD: Well tell us, how do you feel now?


WILLIAM: Ready to take on XANA and his monsters.


But I just can’t wait to see what I look like on Lyoko.


YUMI: Get real, XANA is much more dangerous and devious than you can imagine.


ULRICH: Plus before you can put up a decent fight
on Lyoko it’s gonna take time. A lot of time.


AELITA: At first you better just hang back to check things out.
And to try to learn.


WILLIAM: Okay okay, don’t flip out.


I’m not the kinda guy who tries to steal the show.


ODD: I’m really hoping that XANA doesn’t go on the attack tomorrow.


I’m signed up for the interacademy skateboard championship
and I’m gonna win it too!


YUMI: You’re not someone who likes to steal the show either.


WILLIAM: Odd is right, because in life you should always aim for the top.


ULRICH: Why not, that way when you fall back down you crash a lot harder.


ODD: Thanks for coming with me Ulrich.


ULRICH: Well somebody’s gotta pick you and dust you off
every time you faceplant. I mean, what are friends for Odd?


JIM: Good afternoon everyone.


Kadic Academy is very proud to welcome you all today
to this grand skateboard championship.


I’m sure all of you are going to knock us out with
your nollies, your ollies, your kickflips, and other smith grinds.


ULRICH: Wow incredible, you really up on your skateboarding Jim.


JIM: Yep, I sure am. Actually I was a roller derby champion way back in the 70’s.


ULRICH: Oh what a shame you’d rather not talk about it.


JIM: Actually yeah I’d be glad to, but eh… I don’t have the time.


Okay, end of the pipe all of ya.


ODD: Yeah!


Yee-haw!


ULRICH: Alright!


ODD: And there you go, the perfect combination of exceptional skills
and incredible elegance. In a word, classy.


SAMANTHA: Hey Odd, great run out there.


ODD: S-s-s-sam!
How are you?


SAMANTHA: Not bad.


ULRICH: Now that was real class.


JEREMIE: Hey it works!


AELITA: Really?


JEREMIE: Yeah!


Thanks to this program we should be able to find your father on Lyoko.


AELITA: Let’s go and check it out in the Lab right now.


MILLY: {\i1}And this is the room of our man of the hour, Jeremie Belpois.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Huh? What are you doing here?


MILLY: You’re kidding, don’t tell us your forgot!


TAMIYA: We’re filming you for a whole day for our special edition of Kadic Herald.
A day in the life of Jeremie Belpois.


JEREMIE: You are? I did forget completely.
I’m sorry, but I have too many things to do today.


MILLY: Great! We wanted to film the Kadic Academy valedictorian during his busy day.


TAMIYA: You won’t even know we’re there, I swear!


AELITA: Don’t worry, I’ll go to the computer lab myself.
I’ll call you after I’ve tested the program.


JEREMIE: Okay. I’m all yours now.


ODD: I’m really glad to see you Sam, but aren’t you
supposed to be living somewhere out on the coast?


SAMANTHA: I am, but I also signed up for the championship.
I’m only here for the day.


JIM: Samantha Knight!


SAMANTHA: My turn. Don’t move, I’ll be right back.


ODD: How weird is that to run into her?
I’d almost forgotten how cool and how pretty she is.


ULRICH: And how you’re really in love.


ODD: Come on! Can’t you like somebody without being in love?


ULRICH: Sure I can, but you totally in love good buddy.


AELITA: Oh no!


MILLY: For breakfast do you like juice or milk?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Hot chocolate.


MILLY: {\i1}Eggs or toast?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Cereal.


MILLY: {\i1}Butter or jam?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Maple syrup.


Honestly, are you sure your readers care about this stuff?


MILLY: Look Jeremie, I’m the reporter and I know what our readers want to read.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita? Something wrong?


AELITA: Yes, XANA’s launched an attack on the chamber at Core of Lyoko.


JEREMIE: Okay, tell the others. I’ll be there as soon as I can.


TAMIYA: You’re the reporter? So what does that make me then?
Jeremie’s right you know, those are stupid questions.


MILLY: If you had better ones, what’s stopping you from asking them, huh?


TAMIYA: You are, okay?


JEREMIE: Um, ladies? I have an idea. We can do this interview later on,
after you two have finished fighting with one another.


MILLY: You’re staying here until you’ve finished answering my fascinating questions!


SAMANTHA: Oh that Odd, he’s so... So…


ULRICH: So messy, you wouldn’t believe what his room looks like.


SAMANTHA: He’s like me, my room’s a permanent disaster-zone.


ULRICH: Seems you two were made for each other.


Huh? Aelita?


No problem, I’ll tell Odd and we’ll be right there.


MR. DELMAS: Ulrich Stern?
Someone here would like to see you.


MR. STERN: Hello Ulrich.


ULRICH: Dad? But-


AELITA: Yumi! Emergency, XANA’s attacking the chamber of the Core of Lyoko.


YUMI: Oh no, not today! My parents are gone for the day
and I have to look after by brother.


Okay, calm down. I’ll sneak out when he’s not look-


HIROKI: Dream on sis.


ULRICH: What are you doing here?


MR. STERN: I’m worried about your grades son, that’s the reason I came.
I think you and I have to talk.


ULRICH: I’m sorry, but today… Today’s not a very good time.


MR. STERN: And I think the time is long overdue.


ULRICH: It’s just that I wasn’t expecting to see you an-


MR. STERN: And I wasn’t expecting to receive a report card as bad as yours was.


Come with now will you, Mr. Delmas was kind enough to lend us his office.


ULRICH: Sam. Can you give Odd a message for me?


SAMANTHA: Yeah, sure.


ULRICH: Tell him to get to he knows where right away.


SAMANTHA: Okay.


WILLIAM: Yes? Aelita?
Cool, great! I’ll be right there.


ODD: Wow, now this is what I call fun!
Hey, where did Ulrich go Sam?


SAMANTHA: I don’t know.


ODD: He didn’t say anything?


SAMANTHA: No.


ODD: Okay then tell me, how was I?


SAMANTHA: Wow, you really rock!


YUMI: Come on Hiroki, do me a favor! Lemme go and don’t say anything
to mom and dad, I’ll make it up to you I promise.


HIROKI: You’ll make it up to me how?


YUMI: I uh… Look, you want me to give you my discman?


HIROKI: No.


YUMI: I’ll... I’ll find you the entire saga of Surfer Zombie!


HIROKI: Johny just lended it to me.


YUMI: I’ll… I’ll do all your homework for a month!


HIROKI: Including my math homework?


YUMI: Yes!


HIROKI: Ha, interesting. But no.


YUMI: Ugh!


AELITA: If XANA’s monsters destroy the sphere, Lyoko is gone for good
and without Lyoko we don’t have any way to fight XANA.


WILLIAM: I read you, loud and clear.
Well then, what are we waiting for?


AELITA: For the others to get here.


WILLIAM: They can meet up with us later, let’s not waste time.
After all that’s the reason you recruited me, right?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Mycology is a very complicated science.
It’s the branch of botany that deals with all forms of fungi.


{\i1}There are several thousand species and they range in form of a single cell
to a mass body of branch filamentous hyphae that often produce specialized fruiting bodies.


{\i1}The kingdom includes yeasts, molds, smuts and mushrooms.


MILLY: {\i1}That’s what you call an interesting question?


TAMIYA: My question was fine! It’s the answer that’s a bore.


JEREMIE: Yes Aelita?


MILLY: I’m sorry, but I’ve decided to take back control of this interview.


TAMIYA: Oh sure it’s just typical as soon as I’m the one to ask a question
you get all bent out of shape.


MILLY: Completely untrue!


TAMIYA: No it isn’t!


MILLY: Yes it is!


JEREMIE: William’s right Aelita. Saving Lyoko takes top priority.


{\i1}So go in and I’ll be there as fast as I can
to transfer Odd, Ulrich and Yumi when they show up.


AELITA: Okay, but don’t drag your feet.
Come on, let’s go.


WILLIAM: Yes!


MILLY: And that’s just the way it’s gonna be!


JEREMIE: Uh, ladies? I have to… Go to the bathroom.
You weren’t planning on filming me in the bathroom?


AELITA: I’ve started up the virtualization process to bring us directly into the Sector 5.
We only have a few seconds to get to the scanner room and go in.


WILLIAM: Let’s go.


MILLY: {\i1}How long were you planning on to shoot this door?


TAMIYA: {\i1}It’s interesting to know how long the really good students use the bathroom, right?


MILLY: {\i1}Wrong!


WILLIAM: Wow! That’s a pretty classy gear.
And you? No weapon?


You fight with your bare hands?


What’s your superpower?


AELITA: This isn’t a videogame William,
let me remind that we have an important mission to accomplish.


WILLIAM: Okay okay, sorry. So, where are the monsters?


AELITA: Follow me, we only have a couple minutes to trip a key lever,
that gets us into the chamber of the Core of Lyoko.


WILLIAM: Killer. This is 10000 times better than Galactic Battle.


It’s a movie set, wow.


AELITA: The key, it’s over there!


WILLIAM: I’m on it.


AELITA: No wait!


WILLIAM: What? What’s that noise I hear?


AELITA: Creepers.


WILLIAM: Creepy crawlers? I love this!


You take care of the key, I’ll take care of these guys.


AELITA: Watch it, they can be really tough.


WILLIAM: Works for me. So can I.


Geronimo!


MR. STERN: I really want to understand why your grades are so consistently poor.


ULRICH: It’s just that, I can’t seem to concentrate all of the time.


MR. STERN: Why not?


ULRICH: Well, you remember when you were my age?


MR. STERN: Yes, in your age I had straight A’s, and I was preparing my collage application.


WILLIAM: Wow! I can’t believe it. I am the man.


AELITA: It’s okay William, come over here.


WILLIAM: Wait, just one or two more of them, okay? This is too cool.


AELITA: William! No.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita? What’s going on?
{\i0}Where are Ulrich, Odd and Yumi?


AELITA: {\i1}How would I know? They’re not in the computer lab?


JEREMIE: No.


WILLIAM: {\i1}Hey Jeremie, this is really weird looking creature that just showed up.


Like some kind of a… Giant jellyfish?


JEREMIE: What? Aelita! {\i1}You have to get to William!
Hurry! You have to go around the outside.{\i0}


{\i1}Take the next hallway on your left. No, left!


{\i1}Faster before the Scyphozoa goes after William!


{\i1}Take the corridor on your right, go on!


William, get outta there. Hurry up!
William, do you hear me?


WILLIAM: I’m not afraid of some dumb jellyfish.


JEREMIE: {\i1}William, just do what I say.
I don’t know what the Scyphozoa wants with you, but it can’t be good.


WILLIAM: Rats…


JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita. Take the next hallway on your left, it’s not much further.


{\i1}William! Get outta there right now!
William do you read me?


WILLIAM: Relax, the Scyphozoa hasn’t moved an inch.


It must be scared of- whoa!


JEREMIE: I don’t believe it,
William’s been captured by the Scyphozoa! Oh no!


{\i1}Aelita, XANA’s possessed William through the Scyphozoa.


AELITA: I’m almost there.


William? Are you okay?


MR. STERN: I’m especially conserned about your friends Ulrich.
I don’t think they’re a very good influnce on you.


ULRICH: Huh? How would you know? You don’t know my friends?
You don’t even know me in fact. We haven’t spoken for a year!


MR. STERN: That doesn’t mean I don’t know what is best for you!


ULRICH: Oh yeah? What’s that?


MR. STERN: That you show some respect for your work.
Need I remind you that I’m the one paying and you’re costing me a small fortune.


Huh?


ULRICH: Yes Jeremie? Be right there.
I’ve gotta go.


MR. STERN: I’m not finished speaking to you!


ULRICH: Well I finished listening.


HIROKI: Take one more step and I’ll tell Dad everything!


YUMI: Well what a coincidence, it’s Dad. Go on and tell him.


HIKORI: Daddy… Yumi wants to…


Hey that’s not Dad, that’s Jeremie!


ULRICH: Hey what are you doing? You’re not in the computer lab?


ODD: Why should I be in the lab, I’m in the finals.


ULRICH: But didn’t Sam tell you?


ODD: Tell me what?


JIM: Yeah!


SAMANTHA: I’d like to see you top that.


ODD: Sam, why didn’t you give me Ulrich’s message,
it was really important.


SAMANTHA: Important? I’m sorry, I just…


I just really wanted you to stay,
we’re so lucky to be together again even for a day and I’m leaving tonight.


ODD: I know how you feel Sam, but… There’s something I have to do.


SAMANTHA: Even more important than to hanging out with me?


ODD: Unfortunately yes.


JIM: The next contestant is Odd Della Robbia.
Odd?


JEREMIE: I don’t believe it.


WILLIAM: Ready.


YUMI: {\i1}Jeremie, we’re here.


JEREMIE: {\i1}At last! Get to the scanner room, I’ll explain everything on the way.


Virtualization.


WILLIAM: Fire!


JEREMIE: We’ve just lost the first shield layer!


If the second one goes…


AELITA: Lyoko will disappear forever.


JEREMIE: And William along with it.


At last! They’re there now.


WILLIAM: Fire!


ULRICH: William!


ODD: He doesn’t look too happy to see us.


ULRICH: Yup, looks like me when I saw my father.


AELITA: If we lose Lyoko I lose my father as well.


JEREMIE: That’s right.


AELITA: Is that, is that the program I started a while ago?


JEREMIE: Yes! Unbelievable, it really works!
I found Franz Hopper!


AELITA: Run the rematerialization program, hurry.


ULRICH: Okay, now.


It’s not very nice to attack people from the behind.


YUMI: I knew it was a bad idea to bring you into the group.


JEREMIE: Nothing can stop them anymore.


AELITA: They’re going to destroy the sphere!


JEREMIE: Almost there!


AELITA: It can’t be!


JEREMIE: I couldn’t rematerialize Franz Hopper, I didn’t have enough time.


AELITA: We’ve lost everything.


JEREMIE: William as well.


We have no other way to fight XANA now, the entire world is in danger.


ULRICH: It’s impossible even to imagine.


YUMI: And William… Do you think he’s…


ODD: This is horrible.


AELITA: I was really hoping I’d see my father again.


JEREMIE: I’m sorry, I did everything I could.


AELITA: I know you did Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Huh?


Hey, what?
This is incredible.


ODD: Well tell us, what’s going on?


JEREMIE: I just recieved a coded message,
a message directly from the Internet and it’s signed…


AELITA: Who?


Tell us Jeremie?


JEREMIE: Franz Hopper.
