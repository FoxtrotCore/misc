89 - Music To Soothe the Savage Beast


MRS. HERTZ: Now, pay close attention children.


An electrical charge flows through a section of conductor.


The current's intensity is expressed in amperes.


The source of the tension, however, is measured in volts.


This is what gives it the energy it needs
to maintain the current.


If the tension given out from the source is constant,
a continuous current flows.


ODD: There wasn't one ticket left, completely sold out,
and I absolutely have to find one by tonight.


ULRICH: Relax, Odd, Aelita's gonna give us each a ticket.


She's the opening act at the concert,
and she's got comps for all of us.


ODD: I know that. But the problem is
I need two tickets for tonight.


ULRICH: Ah, so you made a girl a promise
you didn't know if you could keep?


ODD: You could never understand, Ulrich.


MRS. HERTZ: Odd, would you repeat what I just said?
What exactly is an electrical charge?


ODD: (STAMMERING) It's the amount you have to pay
every month for electricity.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


MRS. HERTZ: Not exactly an enlightening answer.


ULRICH: I know someone else
who's a lot more stressed out about tonight.


ODD: Hm?


SFX: (BELL RINGING)


AELITA: ren't you coming to lunch, Jeremie?


JEREMIE: No, I came up with a brand new program
that should help us to locate new Replikas.


I have just one or two more calculations to work out.
See you later!


ODD: I'll see you later too,
I've got a- an important errand to run!


AELITA: (SIGHS)


ODD: Hm.


Hey, Matthias, you wouldn't have a ticket left
for tonight's concert, would you?


MATTHIAS: Yeah, no problem.


ODD: You mean it?


MATTHIAS: This is the last one, and it's all yours.


You're gonna love these guys, Aerosmooth.
They're an incredible group.


ODD: Aerosmooth? (SIGHS)


ULRICH: Subdigitals. I liked them better as the Subsonics.


AELITA: I like their new name.


YUMI: Well, Aelita, all set for the big night?


AELITA: Don't even talk about it, I'm so scared.


YUMI: Welcome to stardom. Listen to this,


"In our next issue, an exclusive interview
with Aelita Stones, Kadic's brightest new star".


Did you know about this?


AELITA: Milly and Tamiya haven't stopped hassling me
for over a week for that interview.


But I didn't promise them anything.


ULRICH: Oh, you know what those two are like,
always looking for a little gossip.


YUMI: Forget about that stuff, think about the concert.


AELITA: Whenever I do, I get major butterflies in my stomach.
I wish I could stop thinking about it.


If I could just get my mind off it for a little while.


I'll go and see if Jeremie needs any help
with his calculations, see you later.


ODD: I don't believe this, I'm jinxed.


The last ticket slipped right under my nose just now.


YUMI: But Aelita's got a free ticket for you.


ULRICH: Yeah, but that's not enough for Odd's little harem.


ODD: Laugh at me, go on, but wait 'til you see Kelly,


then you'll know why I've gotta make
this first date absolutely perfect.


YUMI: You mean to say this is the first time
you're going out together?


ODD: Oh, let's not get into all the details.
It's a shame I can't count on a little help from my friends.


YUMI: Try my brother.
The little weasel must have some sort of connection.


ODD: Hiroki! You're right, I hadn't thought of him.
Yumi, you're a genius!


Ulrich, you really oughta go out with her.


ULRICH: Hey!


Uh, you and I are just good friends, isn't that right?


YUMI: Right.


MILLY: Hello, we're looking for Aelita.


We're supposed to interview her,
do you know where we can find her?


DEFAULT: She went to the gym.


MILLY: Okay.


TAMIYA: Thanks a lot.


ULRICH: Just doing out share to support school journalism.


YUMI: (SIGHS)


NICHOLAS: Aelita, we've been looking all over for you.


HERB: Yeah, we have. Would you give us your autograph?


NICHOLAS: Please, Aelita.


AELITA: (STAMMERING)


HERB: Ow!


SISSI: You dorks! Can't you see that she's just dying to?


AELITA: But-


SISSI: I'm onto you. Mrs. Einstein thinks she's a big star
now that she's a cover girl for a magazine.


AELITA: I didn't know anything about-


SISSI: Everyone know that I should have been picked
to play the opening act of the concert,


and you're bound to make a total fool of yourself tonight.
Hmph, can't wait to see that.


NICHOLAS: And you will, Sissi. In fact, you're gonna have
plenty of time to watch from the audience,


'cause it's Aelita who's gonna be on stage and not you.


SISSI: Hm.


NICHOLAS: Ouch!


SISSI: Idiot!


Hmph!


AELITA: (SIGHS)


SFX: (KNOCKING ON DOOR)


JEREMIE: Come in.


AELITA: Am I disturbing you, Jeremie?


JEREMIE: I just finished running my initial calculations.


Thanks to my program, we'll be able to
find the last Replikas with no problem.


AELITA: Oh, that's great.


(STAMMERS) Say, Jeremie, about tonight...


JEREMIE: Oh right, the concert. I bet you can't wait to get on stage.


AELITA: Um, not really. When I'm alone at my mixing table,
I'm fine, but in such a huge auditorium...


JEREMIE: You'll be great, Aelita, don't worry about it.


AELITA: (SIGHS)


JEREMIE: What's more, Yumi, Ulrich, and Odd will be cheering you on.


AELITA: Hm?


And what about you?


JEREMIE: Uh, I gotta wait until the calculations finish running
and then I've got a couple of things to do,


and so I might be a little late.


But I promise to come, as soon as I'm done.


AELITA: What, as soon as you're done?


I'm dying of stage fright and all you can say
is that you're going to be late to my concert?


JEREMIE: No, that isn't exactly what I meant. I meant to say that
if it's really that important to you, well then-


AELITA: Important? I'm standing here telling you I may not be able
to do it, isn't that important enough for you?


Here's your invitation, you can always give it
to someone else if you don't find the time to come.


SFX: (DOOR SLAMS)


AELITA: (CRYING)


ODD: Hiroki, you've got to be kidding!


HIROKI: Take it or leave it, Odd. I can get double the price
I'm asking you from at least a dozen other kids.


ODD: Um, uh...


You wouldn't take an IOU
from your sister's best friend would you?


HIROKI: Mh mh.


See ya.


SISSI: And if I catch you groveling again in front of that
stuck up pink-haired mouse I'm taking back those comps.


ODD: You know what the mouse thinks of you?


What? You wouldn't have a bunch of comps for tonight, huh?


SISSI: Hmph, what do you think? Being the principal's daughter
has it's advantages.


ODD: And, um, you wouldn't have an extra one by any chance? Hm?


SISSI: I do. But not for you, Odd.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


SISSI: Then again, if you could convince Ulrich to go
to the concert with me, and not that skinny crow...


Well what do you think? Hm?


ODD: Hm.


Okay.


SISSI: Hm.


ODD: Ta-da! (LAUGHS)


YUMI: How was your hunting expedition?


ODD: It was cool. Odd the great wanted a ticket,
Odd the great got a ticket.


ULRICH: And Odd didn't pay an arm and a leg for it?


ODD: Uh, no no no. Oh, oh, and by the way, Ulrich,
I wanna ask you a teeny-weeny favor, okay?


ULRICH: Ask me a favor? Go on, what kind of favor?


ODD: (NERVOUS LAUGHTER)


YUMI: Hm?


ODD: Oh, no big rush, why don't we talk about it later?


AELITA: There you are. I came to give you your tickets for tonight.


YUMI: What's wrong?


AELITA: Oh, it's nothing, it's- it's on account of Jeremie.


ODD: Einstein wins another first prize in diplomacy?


AELITA: Yeah, I guess you might say that.


ULRICH: Oh, relax, Princess, you'll see,
you're gonna bring the house down tonight.


YUMI: For sure.


ODD: Yeah!


AELITA: Anyway, don't get there too late,
the crowd's gonna be really big.


SFX: (CROWD BABBLING)


(KNOCKING ON DOOR)


AELITA: Huh?


ODD: Surprise!


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


ODD: We came to see our favorite star
before she gets too famous to see us.


AELITA: Don't be so silly. I'm really glad to see you all.


Um, didn't Jeremie come?


ULRICH: Sure he did, but we lost him in the crowd.


ODD: You know Einstein, a great head for math,
but it's always in the clouds everywhere else.


YUMI: Don't worry, he'll be out there
listening and cheering you on.


AELITA: I hope so.


SOPHIE: {\i1}Aelita, you're on in five minutes!


AELITA: Time for me to start concentrating.


YUMI: Okay then, we'll take off.


You look beautiful tonight.


You're gonna knock 'em out. (LAUGHS)


KELLY: Odd! Hi!


ODD: Ah, there you are, Kelly. This is Yumi and Ulrich.


ULRICH: Hi.


YUMI: Hello.


KELLY: Oh, hi.


ODD: Let's go.


SISSI: Odd!


ODD: Oh, hey, Sissi, how are you doing?


SISSI: What's that skinny crow doing here?


YUMI: Mh?


SISSI: I gave you a ticket in exchange for a date with Ulrich!


ULRICH: What?


ODD: Well, uh...


SISSI: In that case, give me back my ticket! Hmph!


ODD: Uh, Kelly, you can have mine.


KELLY: Listen, Odd. You told me you spent your last penny
buying tickets to this concert,


not that you were wheeling dealing with Delmas! Loser.


You can keep your ticket.


YUMI: I wonder if she bites.


ULRICH: By the way, Odd, what was that teeny-weeny favor
you wanted me to do?


ODD: Forget it.


SFX: (KNOCKING ON DOOR)


MILLY: Aelita, can we ask you a couple of questions
for the Kadic news?


AELITA: Not now. You couldn't have picked a worse time.


SOPHI: Aelita, you're on in just two minutes.


I'm afraid you'll have to leave now, girls.


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


JEREMIE: Hello?


YUMI: Jeremie, what are you doing? The concert is about to start,
Aelita was really crushed not to see you.


JEREMIE: Oh, I didn't realize how late it was.
Just one more calculation to run, I'll be right there.


Not now!


SOPHIE: (GASPS)


SFX: (CROWD CHEERING)


ODD: It's Aelita's turn now.


AELITA: Sophie. I'm ready.


SOPHIE: So am I.


AELITA: (GASPS)


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


CHRIS: Hello?


SOPHIE: {\i1}Chris? Aelita's not at all well, she{\i0} can't do the first
part of the concert, you'll have to begin without her.


Hm.


CHRIS: Aelita's sick, guys, we're going on cold
without an opening act.


BEN: That's a real bummer, I sure hope it's not serious.


NICO: Anyway, let's go get 'em.


CHRIS: Hm.


DEFAULT: {\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, the Subdigitals!


SFX: (CROWD CHEERING)


SFX: (PLANET NET BEGINS PLAYING)


ODD: But why didn't Aelita go on?


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


YUMI: Jeremie?


JEREMIE: Xana's just launched an attack!


YUMI: {\i1}They just canceled Aelita's opening act!


JEREMIE: That sounds like Xana. Check it out,
and then meet me at the factory.


YUMI: Xana alert, let's go backstage and see if Aelita's okay.


There she is, over there!


YUMI: (GASPS)


ODD: Uh, you think maybe they're angry because they blew a scoop?


ULRICH: I'll try to distract them. You guys go and get Aelita back.


ODD: Good luck dealing with the press!


DEFAULT: (SCREECHING)


SFX: (PLANET NET CONTINUES TO PLAY)


(CROWD CHEERING)


(PHONE RINGING)


YUMI: Jeremie, a woman's taken Aelita away,
she's probably heading for the factory.


JEREMIE: Okay, I'll try to head her off. You guys better hurry it up.


Ow!


SOPHIE: Scanner Aelita.


{\i1}Virtualization.


AELITA: (GRUNTS)


Huh?


(GASPS)

JEREMIE: (GRUNTS)


AELITA: (GRUNTS)


SFX: (SCREECHING)


AELITA: (SIGHS) I'm surrounded.


{\i1}Jeremie, if you can hear, answer me!


ODD: Lateral crossing pattern and pincer strategy.


YUMI: What's that in english?


ODD: Let's go!


YUMI: Yes!


How was that for strategy?


ODD: Hm.


Guess we beat you here, Einstein.


JEREMIE: Where's Aelita?


YUMI: She already got virtualized on Lyoko.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita, are you okay?


AELITA: Jeremie! At last!


This isn't exactly where I was expecting you,
but I'm happy to hear your voice.


JEREMIE: {\i1}I'm sorry about the concert-


AELITA: We'll talk about it another time.


William!


JEREMIE: Are you ready?


{\i1}Transfer Yumi.


{\i1}Transfer Odd.


AELITA: William is here.


JEREMIE: {\i1}I saw him. I'm sending in the cavalry.


Scanner Yumi.


Scanner Odd.


Virtualization.


ODD: Nice one, Yumi.


YUMI: Thank you.


Ready for the tall, dark bad guy?


ODD: Uh, I think we have an audience.


YUMI: Jeremie, we're stuck here.
No way to reach Aelita without transport.


JEREMIE: Okay, Yumi, we'll have your vehicles in no time.


ODD: (LAUGHING)


Laser arrow!


ULRICH: (PANTING)


(SCREAMING)


Awfully sorry, ladies, but no interviews.


ODD: Shield!


SOPHIE: (GASPS)


YUMI: Odd, lateral flight pattern and pincer strategy.


ODD: Are you speaking English?


Laser arrow!


Great- huh? What's going on?


Close one!


YUMI: Jeremie?


ODD: This time we're on our own. No help from the factory.


We're bombing on this one!
We're gonna have to change the music!


ULRICH: (GRUNTS)


Huh?


YUMI: Odd, trampoline spinning top action.


ODD: Gotcha.


WILLIAM: It's game over for you, Yumi.


YUMI: For you too, handsome.


WILLIAM: Huh?


ODD: Oh, great. I was in the mood fish today.


Whoa!


SFX: (CROWD CHEERING)


CHRIS: Rock and roll!


SFX: (BREAK AWAY BEGINS PLAYING)


AELITA: Oh no!


ODD: Keep your distance from the sky, guys!


Laser arrow!


AELITA: Odd!


ODD: Okay, let's go, Princess.


AELITA: (LAUGHING)


SOPHIE: (LAUGHING)


JEREMIE: No!


AELITA: Tower deactivated.


JEREMIE: Return to the past now.


SFX: (KNOCKING ON DOOR)


AELITA: Come in.


JEREMIE: I, uh, wanted to see how you were doing, Aelita.


AELITA: Well I have less stage fright. But I guess it's because
I've already been here if you know what I mean.


JEREMIE: No way I was gonna miss the concert for the second time.


AELITA: You know, I- I didn't mean to blow up at you like that.


I put too much pressure on myself.
Maybe it was insane to wanna do this concert.


JEREMIE: Aelita, sometimes the sanest thing is to be insane.


AELITA: (LAUGHS)


DEFAULT: {\i1}And now, let's put 'em together
for a brand new DJ, Aelita Stones!
