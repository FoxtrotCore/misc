84 - Guided Missile


JIM: Romain Le Gauff?


DEFAULT: Here.


JIM: Jeremie Belpois?


JEREMIE: Here Jim!


JIM: Annique Pirané?


ODD: That’s the second letter for you today.
It’s not fair- I haven’t gotten any.


AELITA: Be patient, Odd.
Mail call’s not over- there’s still hope!


And I haven’t gotten anything either!


ODD: Yeah, but you don’t know anyone else besides us.


Sorry Aelita, I didn’t mean it that way…


JIM: Aelita Stones, there’s a postcard for you.


AELITA: That’s weird.


ULRICH: Tell us who it’s from!


AELITA: I have no idea…


JEREMIE: I bet it’s from XANA.


He must be on vacation.
We’ve had no sign of him!


AELITA: {\i1}Hi Aelita!
{\i1}Thinking of you in Montreal.


{\i1}Warmest regards.


There’s no signature.


ODD: I wouldn’t mind getting something signed or not…


JIM: Finally, this is for Odd Della Robbia-
Last, of course, like he is in everything!


ODD: Well it’s about time!


I was wondering how long my parents would forget
would forget their favorite son!


And I’ll bet it’s packed with lots of goodies!


But don’t worry, as you know, I’m very generous by nature.
Huh?


I wonder what’s inside.


Is that all there is?
Dog food and nothing else at all?!


ULRICH: Makes you wonder who their real son is- you or Kiwi!
