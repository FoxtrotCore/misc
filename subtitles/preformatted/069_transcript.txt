69 - Wreck Room


ULRICH: You’re not sick are you, Odd? Usually you start the day singing something from Paco the King of Disco.


ODD: I dreamt about a deadly epidemic that was transmitted by potatoes,
meaning there were no more french fries or mashed potatoes for lunch.


Do you believe in nightmares like that, huh?


ULRICH: Absolutely. But don’t worry, if you ask Einstein nicely he’ll program you some virtual fries.


ODD: Food is sacred, Ulrich, so no jokes, okay?


ULRICH: Speaking of Einstein, I wonder where he is.


Hey Jeremie, forget you had a bed?


JEREMIE: I spent the night on the recovery program to bring back William. Hey, what’s the time?


ULRICH: Ten to[d], better hurry, we wouldn’t want to miss the blockbuster math class on Thales' theorem, would we?


JEREMIE: Okay, see you there. Anyway, I finished the program. Soon as classes are over, we can launch it.


ROSA: You’re too late. You can’t have seconds today.


JEREMIE: But, I haven’t even had firsts.


ROSA: You did, Jeremie. Odd Della Robbia said you gave him your portion.


ULRICH: Well done, no sleep, no meal, nothing like leading a healthy life.


ODD: What’s wrong, Ulrich told me that you were skipping breakfast.
It would have been a pity to waste a good meal. You want half of my banana?


JEREMIE: No thanks, I lost my appetite.


AELITA: You’d better not deny that you pig out all the time.


ODD: It’s not exactly pigging out, it’s more like, survival instinct.


JEREMIE: Huh, survival?


ODD: Yeah, I’ve got to store food reserves in case potatoes get contaminated.
Like in the nightmare I had last night.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


MR. DELMAS: Your attention please, boys and girls, I have an important announcement to make.


ODD: That’s it, my nightmare’s come true, goodbye potatoes forever.


MR. DELMAS: This afternoon after class we will have the grand opening of the recreation room you’ve all been waiting for.


ODD: There’s no epidemic? Long live french fries, yahoo!


MR. DELMAS: (CLEARS THROAT)


This recreation room for boarding students was designed for relaxation.
You will have at your disposal a foosball table in addition to a table for ping pong, and a television set.


DEFAULT: (CHEERING AND CLAPPING)


MR. DELMAS: Alright, quiet down please.


Remember that with privileges come responsibilities, meaning taking care of your rec room.
And that responsibility begins today with the election of a monitor to supervise its use.


YUMI: Hi everybody, what’s happening?


AELITA: We have to elect a monitor for the new rec room.


JEREMIE: Oh no, I left my computer upstairs. I’ll see you later.


SISSI: It seems to me that as the principal’s daughter, I’m the most obvious choice.


MILLY: Huh?


ODD: No way, forget about it. If Sissi’s elected monitor, I think I’d rather go to the study hall.
We want a rec room where we can have a little fun.


SISSI: Oh yeah, then who would you pick, huh, yourself?


ODD: Why not me? Remember I was already elected class rep.


DEFAULT: Yeah, that’s right!


SISSI: No one would know that you’re our rep, you never seem to have enough time!


YUMI: She’s right, Odd, Xana’s not gonna give you the time to supervise anything.


SISSI: It’s none of your business, Yumi. You’re a day student.
Of course if Odd is elected, you and your little gang will take over the rec room.


DEFAULT: Yeah, hey!


JIM: Okay, what’s going on? Time to go to class, go on now.


MILLY: But we’re trying to elect the rec room monitor, Jim, and we ee-


JIM: You call all this screaming an election?
We’re gonna do this demographical… democrackingly, uh… we’re gonna vote, okay?


You and you, over there.


Now let’s see… Fiquet, LeDuc, Dunbar, over here too.


WILLIAM: Huh? Is that me?


JIM: C’mon, we haven’t got all day!


Now, whoever wants to vote for Anais Fiquet, hands up now.


SFX: (DOOR CLOSES)


JIM: With two votes more than Elizabeth Delmas, the winner is Dunbar.


WILLIAM: Hm?


SISSI: Hmph.


WILLIAM: (LAUGHING) I won! Does anyone know what I won?


JIM: And now everyone, break ranks. I’ll tell the principal who won the election.


MILLY: William, how about a word for the Kadic News?
Some of the kids think you were elected because you’re not part of a group.


Do you think it’s a victory for democracy?


WILLIAM: Uh, Democracies? Who’s he anyway? I thought it was me who won this time.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


JEREMIE: Hey, what happened?


YUMI: A disaster.


MRS. MEYERS: Now then, to sum up Thales’s theorem, in a triangle A-B-C, if I is a point on A-B and J is a point on AC then I-J ... I-A-B, A-J-I is … A-B-C, it’s quite simple! I’m going through a few examples left ... for homework.[e]


JEREMIE: This is a disaster. William’s copy doesn’t have the same personality as the original.
He can blend in with a crowd, but alone he stands out like a sore thumb.


ULRICH: Well at least for now, nobody thinks what he says is stupid, they think he’s like a comedian.


JEREMIE: Yeah, but they’re bound to get on to him.
After school I’d better launch the recovery program for getting back the real William.


ULRICH: I hope it works Jeremie, ‘cause the one we have now is about as brilliant as Kiwi.


ODD: Hey, my dog is very very intelligent, so there!


MRS. MEYERS: Odd, do you want to add a corollary to Thales’s theorem?


ODD: Uh, what collar ma’am? Uh, no my dog doesn’t have any fleas.


MRS. MEYERS: Huh?


ODD: (STAMMERING) Uh, I mean I don’t have a dog, or fleas either.


SFX: (BELL RINGING)


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


JEREMIE: Well I’ll run over to the factory now and start the recovery program, and then-


AELITA: I’ll go with you. That way we can both welcome William home, okay?


JEREMIE: Yeah, why not?


ULRICH: We’ll go to the rec room so there’ll be three of us to stop his double from doing anything dumb.


WILLIAM: Oh no, the lock is broken.


JIM: You’re turning the key the wrong way you chowderhead.


DEFAULT: Huh, nice!


DEFAULT: Wow, yeah!


JIM: Now I want you all to behave like adults. And don’t forget, this recreation room is under your responsibility.


Whoa!


Ping pong, my favorite game!


AELITA: Jeremie, William’s coming back, I just can’t wait!


JEREMIE: Uh, me neither!


JIM: Listen you kids, we’re gonna break in this table right now.
Okay, Della Robbia, over here, best of three sets, are you ready?


ODD: Oh no, how am I gonna keep an eye on William?


ULRICH: Go on, we’ll handle him.


HEIDI: William, could you open the fridge for me?


WILLIAM: Huh?


YUMI: Hey, don’t waste his time. Monitors should step back from things like that.


WILLIAM: Step back? If I do, I’ll bang into the wall.


AELITA: Are you gonna use the tower of William’s clone?


JEREMIE: Yeah, because the original William’s digital DNA is stored in that tower.


JIM: {\i1}(LAUGHING) Twenty to five! Match point!


Twenty one! You lose!


(LAUGHING) I was interstate champion when I was young.
Why don’t I tell you why I used to be called The Killer Racquet?


ODD: Uh, thanks Jim, maybe some other time.


JIM: Well for once I’d rather have talked about it.


Dunbar, don’t just stand there like a statue, c’mon, it’s your turn!


YUMI: Jim, he can’t play and be monitor at the same time.


ULRICH: I’ll play against you, Jim!


JIM: No, no. I need someone of my caliber.


C’mon, let’s see how you play, Dunbar.


JEREMIE: Here goes.


Dunbar, don’t you know what ping pong’s all about?


No.


DEFAULT: Just for you, ladies this fabulous hair remover for only 29.99!


NICOLAS: TV shopping, oh what a drag.


SISSI: I’ve got the remote, so I decide, hmph!


HERB: Why don’t you switch over to one of the science channels, huh, Sissi?


SISSI: Yeah, sure.


HERB: Really? Do you mean that?


SISSI: What do you think, nerd?


JEREMIE: Oh no, there’s a bug[f] in the program! I sure hope it didn’t put the tower offline.


JIM: It’s already match point Dunbar. Try to score one point at least.


WILLIAM: (STUTTERING)


JIM: That’s impossible. Beginner’s luck!


WILLIAM: Killer Racquet, was that it, Jim? Well before I’m finished with you, they’re gonna call you Clumsy Racquet! Ready?


JIM: Well we’ll just see about that!


ULRICH: I’ll betcha that Einstein just tweaked the program.


YUMI: Anyway, we’ve got to come up with something, and right now.


ODD: I have an idea.


JIM: Your serve, Dunbar.


ODD: Achoo!


JIM: Ah, Della Robbia! You trying to distract me or what, you little cheater!


WILLIAM: Hey, out of the way, loser!


YUMI: I’ll call Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Yumi, what’s up?


YUMI: {\i1}What’s up with you? He’s worse than ever.


JEREMIE: The program has bugged some files[g] in the tower.
But I don’t know which ones, and it’s impossible to deactivate so I can begin all over again.


AELITA: We’ll have to deactivate the program manually[h]. I’m going to Lyoko.


JEREMIE: All alone? No, it’s too dangerous!


AELITA: The super scan doesn’t show any Xana attack. Anyway, do we have a choice?


JEREMIE: Hm. No. Okay, but be careful.


Transfer, Aelita.


Scanner.


Virtualization.


AELITA: Jeremie, what’s going on?


JEREMIE: Aelita, your identification file is all bugged up as well!


{\i1}The tower doesn’t recognize you.


It’s too risky, I’ve got to get you back.


AELITA: {\i1}No Jeremie,{\i0} then I wouldn’t be able to get back quickly if Xana attacks.


{\i1}Try to debug the tower. I’ll stay here and wait.


JEREMIE: I’m not convinced, Aelita.


Oh no, Aelita! I told you it was dangerous! You’ve got visitors.


I’m programming you an overwing. You’d better take shelter in another tower.


AELITA: Catch me if you can, ladies!


JEREMIE: Bad news, Xana’s trying to take over the tower!


AELITA: I’ll handle the tarantulas.


WILLIAM: (SCREAMS)


JIM: Ha ha! It’s match point again! You’re not such a big shot now, huh?


JEREMIE: I haven’t even got a way to transfer energy from Sector Five to protect the tower! That’s also bugged up.


AELITA: Energy field!


WILLIAM: (MOANING)


JIM: Finito! Out! Basta! Yours truly, Big Jim the Killer Racquet strikes again!


SFX: (PHONE BEEPS)


ODD: Whew, Einstein saved us in the nick of time.


YUMI: Not quite. To the factory, let’s go!


JIM: Dunbar, what’s the matter you?


JIM: (SCREAMING)


DEFAULT: Let’s get out of here!


ODD: C’mon, let’s get out of here!


YUMI: Let’s split up, that way, one or two of us will get to the factory.


DEFAULT: Okay!


SISSI: What’s gotten into William? Why did he turn into Dr. Shrank?


(SCREAMS)


ULRICH: I’m the one he wants, you’re okay.


SISSI: Ulrich, don’t leave me here, I beg you, please!


ULRICH: Oh, that’s all I needed. Come on, hurry up!


AELITA: Energy Field!


One down. How’s it going, Jeremie?


JEREMIE: The tower won’t recognize your ID, Aelita!


Aelita, at 300 meters south from where you are!


AELITA: Huh? What? It’s…


{\i1}It’s…


JEREMIE: William. Yeah, it’s him.


AELITA: Fantastic! The program worked! I’ll go help him!


JEREMIE: {\i1}No, Aelita, wait.


It could be a trap.


AELITA: But what if the program really worked? This is our only chance to bring back William!


JEREMIE: Well go on then. But be careful.


AELITA: {\i1}Okay.


ULRICH: That’ll hold him for a while.


YUMI: Did you see Ulrich?


ODD: Yeah, he had the copy on his tail.


YUMI: Let’s hurry up.


ULRICH: It’s shut!


SISSI: It’s all over for us!


ULRICH: Maybe not.


Gimme your hand!


WILLIAM: Hm?


AELITA: Need a little help?


You’re back at last, that’s great!


WILLIAM: Good to see you again, Aelita.


AELITA: Oh no! Jeremie!


JEREMIE: Aelita!


ULRICH: Hurry up!


JEREMIE: Ulrich’s not with you?


ODD: He’s playing the clown with the clone.


JEREMIE: Rats! Hurry guys, get into the scanner room now.


{\i1}Aelita! Get a move on! If he leads you into the digital sea{\i0} you’ll be virtualized for good, the same as your father.


ULRICH: Oh no, why me?


ODD: Hop on, princess and stand clear of the closing doors, all aboard!


YUMI: You sure are a tough customer.


SISSI: Faster, Ulrich!


ULRICH: I can’t, I… I just can’t!


SISSI: Go away, you monster!


ULRICH: I’ll hold him here while you escape!


SISSI: I won’t go!


JEREMIE: Identification, Aelita.


Oh no, not again! I’m never gonna get there.


{\i1}Aelita, you’re going to have to wait before you can enter the tower.


AELITA: Okay, one for each of us.


SISSI: Ulrich, come on!


ULRICH: Too late.


You and me, William.


SISSI: Ulrich!


Hands off, William, don’t you touch my Ulrich!


ULRICH: Sorry to say this, Sissi, but you’re not as light as you say you are.


JEREMIE: Aelita, Odd, William’s heading straight for you! It’s all over.


ODD: Great, it was already hard enough without William.


This way, sweetie pie!


You’re gonna have to do better than that!


Hey! I’ll bet you can’t climb, either!


Don’t tell me you’re not even gonna try.


SISSI: Ulrich, you’re gonna fall if you don’t let me go, go on!


ULRICH: Don’t be silly, Sissi, we’re both gonna get out of this, you’ll see.


JEREMIE: Hurry up, will you?


I did it!


AELITA: Bravo, Jeremie! One last thing to take care of and I’m in.


Energy Field!


ODD: Bonzai!


Oh, sorry, William, I forgot to hit the breaks.


SFX: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)


SISSI: Ulrich, we’re saved!


ULRICH: I’m not so sure of that.


JEREMIE: Return to the past, now.


SISSI: It seems to me that as the principal’s daughter, I’m the obvious choice.


ODD: That’s true, now that’s a great idea.


SISSI: Huh?


ULRICH: Yeah, we need somebody who’s unselfish and never thinks about herself, and Sissi really fits that description.


DEFAULT: Mh hm.


SISSI: What are you five up to, anyway?


ODD: It’s unanimous then, huh?


DEFAULT: Yeah, I guess.


JIM: Hey, what’s going on, it’s time to go back to class now.


ULRICH: We know, Jim, we just elected Sissi monitor of the rec room.


JIM: You did? Well I thought you’d choose somebody like Dunbar[i]. Yeah, right, I could see him.


WILLIAM: But how could you not see me? I’m in front of you.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


ODD: That William’s such a comedian! He knocks me out!


ULRICH: He must be the funniest kid at Kadic!


WILLIAM: Yeah, why?


YUMI: It’s nothing, c’mon, let’s go to history class.


AELITA: Well the copy’s all we’ve got.


JEREMIE: For now, anyway. It’s back to square one. I’ll bring back William one day.


I swear I will.
