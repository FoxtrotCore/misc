ULRICH: Okay.

Heads, it’s Odd first.
And tails, it’s Yumi.

Heads. Odd.
Huh, Yumi. I lose.

Hey Yumi, are you okay?

YUMI: What am I doing over here, huh?

ODD: Uh, I, uh… I think we got a little problem here.

Well?

JEREMIE: I guess there’s a little bug in the rematerialization program.

YUMI: You call this a little bug? We can’t stay this way!

ODD: Well, what if we went back to Lyoko and devirtualized all over again?
Maybe everything will go back to normal.

JEREMIE: And what if the program messes up again, and you don’t have any bodies
at all this time?

ODD: Uh, okay. Bad idea.

ULRICH: Uh, so what do we do then?

JEREMIE: Gotta fix the program.

ODD: How long will it take you? A couple of hours at the most?

JEREMIE: Um, if I work through the night, it might be ready by tomorrow morning.

YUMI: What? You mean that I’m gonna have to sleep in a guy’s body?

JEREMIE: Well, I’m not gonna get any sleep at all, I’ll have you know!

YUMI: And if you haven’t noticed, I have a dynamite body! Better than yours!
For example, something’s itching in my back. It’s a…

I think it’s the strap to your--

YUMI: Don’t you dare take it off, you hear?

AELITA: Don’t you guys worry about it, I’ll be helping Jeremie tonight.
Everything will be fine by tomorrow morning.

ODD: I hope so.

YUMI: Not as much as I do.

Okay, so what’s my schedule for this evening?

ODD: Well, try the three B’s - bacon, bath, bedtime. What about me?

YUMI: Same here, but Japanese style. Just try not to say anything stupid in front of
my parents. Can you even use chopsticks?

ODD: Yeah, as long as they look like forks.

YUMI: Ha ha, very funny. Don’t do anything stupid with my body either!

ODD: Mine’s still under warranty!

YUMI: I think you better brush your teeth and go to bed early tonight.

ULRICH: Isn’t tonight the night you’re supposed to break up with Magali?

ODD: Yeah, that’s right. And with Claire, too.

ULRICH: You’re going steady with two girls at the same time? I didn’t know that.

ODD: Neither do Magali and Claire. Not until now, that is.

Hey! I’ve got a great idea! You’re always too shy to ask Yumi out, right?
Now you can practice on me!

ULRICH: Odd, that’s not a great idea, that’s a stupid idea, and anyway, I’m not
that crazy about Yumi.

ODD: Yeah, right, tell me about it.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you to give it a shot

without really sticking your neck out! And this way, I can give you some pointers, too.

ULRICH: Pointers, you?

ODD: Come on, ask me out. I’m waiting.

SISSI: Well, look who’s here. Romeo and Juliet.

ODD: Sissi, I can’t believe it. What a lamebrain.

ULRICH: My dear Ulrich, when will you understand that I am the girl for you?
What do you see in this string bean, anyway?

ODD: At least I don’t have the mind of a vegetable!

SISSI: Huh?

ODD: Give it a rest, Sissi. Ulrich and I were made for one another. You got that?

SISSI: Why, that- that- that… that’s disgusting!

TAMIYA: Oh wow, the scoop of the year! I’ve got it!

ULRICH: What?

ODD: Hey, now I see why Sissi’s so crazy about you.

ULRICH: Do that one more time, and you’re dead.

ODD: Well.
You try to do a friend a favor, and that’s the thanks you get.

KIWI: (GROWLS)

YUMI: No, that’s not it. Cut it out, Kiwi. There’s no reason to growl, it’s me, Yumi.

Ah, this should be it! Time to go. See you later, Kiwi.

KIWI: (BARKS)

YUMI: Be a good, now. Goodbye, Kiwi.

MAGALI: Odd!

YUMI: What?

Ow!

MAGALI: I know all about Claire. You’re so… despicable!

YUMI: Ugh…

CLAIRE: Odd! I know all about Magali! You sneaky rat!

SISSI: Odd?

YUMI: Huh?

SISSI: You can tell Ulrich he’ll have to beg for a date with a real flower once his
string bean veggie drops him!

YUMI: Mhmm.

ULRICH: Hey, Yumi!

What are you doing? Did you find it?

YUMI: Uh, yeah, here it is. Sissi just told me to tell you something, something about
veggies? I didn’t get it. What’s going on?

ULRICH: Nothing. Are you coming? Let’s go to the cafeteria.

MILLY: Ulrich, do you mind answering a few questions for our academy gossip column?

ULRICH: Yes, I do mind.

YUMI: What has gotten into you now?

ULRICH: Ask that imbecile, Odd.

ODD: Well, did you find it? I’ve had it ever since I was really little.

MR. ISHIYAMA: Why, Yumi, what’s the matter?

ODD: Huh?

YUMI: {\i1}Only in case of emergency, okay?

ODD: Hm.

(LAUGHS)

Um… actually, I’m- I’m- I’m not very hungry, so, uh, I better go to bed.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

MR. ISHIYAMA: Why is she speaking to us in Chinese now?

HIROKI: It’s love, hahaha! Oh Ulrich, I wuv you!

MRS. ISHIYAMA: Hiroki!

ODD: Huh?

YUMI: You’ll see. You’ll get used to me in no time. Nice puppy.

Huh?

ULRICH: Yumi, are you okay?

YUMI: I-I thought my hand was disappearing for a minute. I must’ve imagined it.

ULRICH: Oh.

Don’t worry, you can tell Jeremie about it tomorrow morning.

YUMI: Yeah, I guess it can wait.

ULRICH: Watch yourself.

YUMI: Watch what?

Oh- awwww! Aw, gross!

ULRICH: I warned you. It’s more powerful than a laser arrow.

JEREMIE: I was right, Aelita. It’s definitely a bug in the rematerialization program.

Huh? Aelita?

YUMI: Oh, please, Kiwi!

Uh, Ulrich…

ULRICH: I hope that Jeremie found the bug.

MRS. ISHIYAMA: Yumi, are you up? {\i1}Could you give me a hand with breakfast?{\i1}@

ODD: Uh, yes, if… if I had a hand to give you.

YUMI: It only lasted a few seconds, but my hands completely disappeared.

JEREMIE: Strange. I’ll be a lot happier when both of you are back in your own bodies.
I fixed the program. We just need to restart it from Lyoko.

We’ll go to the factory at lunchtime.

ULRICH: See? Everything’s fine.

YUMI: Uh, no. Everything’s very bad.

ODD: Ni-hao!

JEREMIE: Huh?

YUMI: First of all, that’s Chinese, and second of all, what is with that outfit?

ODD: Well, they’re your clothes. Cool, huh? Looks really good.

YUMI: You are so lucky that you’re in my body right now or I would beat you to a pulp!
Go home, you hear, and change before the entire school sees you!

MILLY: Yumi Ishiyama, transformed by love! Cool headline, huh?

TAMIYA: It’ll double our circulation!

YUMI: What are they talking about with this love thing?

ODD: Um… no time to explain! Don’t wanna be late for math class!

Sayonara!

TEACHER: Take out your pens, please. Pop quiz on linear functions.

ODD: Oh man, bad break. Yumi’s gonna kill me.

WILLIAM: Do you always have conversations with yourself?

ODD: Well, yes, they call it a split personality, but nothing to worry about.

WILLIAM: Right, is that why you’re dressed like that?

ODD: Well, um… kind of.

Uh, ma’am, I have a sore throat, can I go to the infirmary?

TEACHER: Uh, yes, of course, Yumi. Go ahead.

JEREMIE: No one noticed anything in class?

ODD: No, they were all concentrating on the math quiz.

YUMI: Huh? There was a math quiz this morning? Did you manage?

ODD: Well, if you mean sharpening my pencils and all that, yeah.

AELITA: What do you think the problem is, Jeremie?

JEREMIE: Odd and Yumi have been rematerialized in bodies that aren’t their own,
and so they aren’t stable.

ULRICH: And?

JEREMIE: If we don’t take care of the problem immediately, their atoms might split.

ODD: What do you mean, our atoms might split?

JEREMIE: Complete disintegration.

YUMI: Great.

JEREMIE: Head for the scanner room. I’m sending you down to the Ice Sector.

You’ll have to get to a waytower due north from where you arrive.
Aelita will reboot the program from that tower

and the nightmare should be over.

{\i1}Aelita and Ulrich, you go in first.

Transfer, Ulrich!

Transfer, Aelita!

Virtualization!

Transfer, Odd-- no, I mean, that is, uh, Yumi-- uh, no, wait, um… oh whatever.
Transfer, scanner, virtualization!

YUMI: And now, let’s hear it for Catwoman…

ODD: Uh… uh… woah!

DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)

AELITA: There’s the tower!

JEREMIE: {\i1}Hurry up! XANA might want to send a welcome committee.

AELITA: Be right back!

ODD: I hope Aelita makes it fast! This is turning into an emergency here!

ULRICH: Kankrelats. That’s all we need.

ODD: Gee, thanks for the heads up, Jeremie.

JEREMIE: Sorry, but... watch it. Whatever happens, Odd or Yumi can’t be devirtualized.
If they go, it’s bye-bye for good.

ODD: Laser arrow! But… hey… oh no, I forgot!

Heheheh…

ULRICH: Super sprint!

YUMI: Odd, how do the arrows work?

ODD: Well, you imagine you’re firing. You concentrate a little bit, and bingo! It fires!

YUMI: Like this?

ODD: Hey!

YUMI: Oops, sorry.

AELITA: Uh, Jeremie, we’ve got a big problem! I can’t do anything from here!
The program’s being run by inhibitors!

JEREMIE: We have to deactivate them! I’ll try to find them!

Oh no!

ULRICH: Thank you for caring.

ODD: We’re doing all we can, you know.

AELITA: Hurry, we have to get to Sector Five!

ODD: Huh? But what for?

JEREMIE: I’ll explain on the way. I’m bringing up your vehicles.

YUMI: Are you absolutely sure we have to go into Sector Five?

JEREMIE: We don’t have time for me to try and crack the millions of codes to
find those inhibitors.

{\i1}Remember, if you don’t get back into your old bodies quickly,
it means disintegration!

ULRICH: And what’s more, seeing how you handled those arrows, you might
accidentally kill Odd before then!

JEREMIE: Are you ready? I’m entering the code Scipio.

ULRICH: A Megatank!

YUMI: Ulrich!

ULRICH: Oh, I can’t believe I could possibly be so dumb.

JEREMIE: Holosphere system connected.

YUMI: Ugh, I feel like I’m gonna be sick.

ODD: Oh yeah, the transporter does make me feel like throwing up.
Tough break for you.

AELITA: Watch out, the wall is about to open!

ULRICH: Well?

JEREMIE: The countdown has started, so hurry it up!
And watch out for the Scyphozoa!

AELITA: Problem here!

YUMI: XANA’s a pretty lame architect, he forgot to put the stairs in!

AELITA: There’s the key!

YUMI: Great, anyone know how to fly?

ODD: Great shot, you missed a Creeper ten yards in a hallway?

Wow, cool!

JEREMIE: {\i1}XANA’s modified the gravity in this room!

ODD: Hey!

JEREMIE: Odd, move it! We’re coming to the end of the countdown!

ODD: Darn, I didn’t get enough momentum!

YUMI: Odd, what are you doing?

ODD: Can’t you see? I’m swimming through guacamole!

YUMI: Shield!

How many life points do you have left?

ODD: Lots, why?

JEREMIE: Great job!
ULRICH: Yeah!

YUMI: Bullseye!

ODD: Look out! Creepers behind you!

YUMI: Aelita, no!

JEREMIE: Aelita, the Scyphozoa!

ODD: Oh no, not now!

JEREMIE Aelita!

ODD: Yes!

JEREMIE: Phew.

YUMI: You okay, Aelita?

AELITA: Yeah.

Here I go.

YUMI: Jeremie, every time we dematerialize, it lasts longer and longer.

JEREMIE: Aelita better find the code, and fast!

YUMI: Careful, a Creeper!

JEREMIE: Aelita, what’s going on?

AELITA: I’m almost there!

JEREMIE: {\i1}Quick, deactivate the inhibitors as fast as you can and
don’t hang around there too long! Things are gonna get messy!

YUMI: Ow!

JEREMIE: No…

{\i1}Aelita, hurry!

They’re in the final stage of disintegration.

YUMI: Ugh!

JEREMIE: {\i1}Hurry up, Aelita!

AELITA: That’s it! Done, Jeremie! You can take over again now!

JEREMIE: Okay, I’ve got it! I’ll transfer back to the {\i1}rematerialization program.{\i1}@

ODD: Yumi, no!

JEREMIE: I sure hope the tweak on the rematerialization program worked.

ULRICH: I’m going to to the scanner room.

Odd! Is that… is that you?

ODD: Of course. What’s the matter with you? Don’t you recognize your own friends?

ULRICH: Dork.

{\i1}It’s okay, Jeremie, we’ve got full recovery!

JEREMIE: Great!

ULRICH: Heads, it’s Yumi who shows up first. Tails, and it’s Odd.

Tails!

JEREMIE: Tails it is.

ODD: Yumi wasn’t too mad at me in the end. I mean, about her parents,
or the math quiz, or the clothes, or for taking a couple of slaps.

She is really cool.

You oughta go out with her.

ULRICH: Speak of, uh… did you tell her what happened between us?

ODD: No way! I plan on staying alive, good buddy.

AELITA: Why? What did happen between you?

DEFAULT: Oh, nothing.

JEREMIE: Hey, speaking of Yumi, look. She’s over there with the school paper.

ODD: Uh-oh.

I don’t like this.

YUMI: Odd.

ODD: Ulrich, help me!

ULRICH: I warned you. Sorry I can’t give you any pointers, good buddy.

YUMI: ODD!
