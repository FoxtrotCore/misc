80 - Dog Day Afternoon


ULRICH: Odd, hurry up.


ODD: Okay, I’m coming…


JEREMIE: You’re not wearing socks to get a better feel for the track?


ODD: No, I forgot to put them on.
Boy am I gonna have blisters.


ULRICH: The way you sweat, you'll probably have to
chuck your sneakers.


ODD: Hm?


Nice one, Kiwi!


Did you see that?


Kiwi opened the door to our room,
and then he managed to find me all the way


on the other side of the campus!


ULRICH: He followed the smell of your feet- easy!


ODD: Ha ha ha!
Very funny!


Your jokes stink worse than my feet.


JIM: On your marks, get set- go!


SISSI: Yoohoo! Ulrich!


Hey, how do I look?


ULRICH: I’m not sure you really want to know.


SISSI: Hmph.


ULRICH: Hey Yumi!


JIM: Go!


Very good time!


{\i1}Huh?!


Dunbar!


When I go, it means go!


Two-letter words aren’t that hard, are they?


Either his ears need washing or he’s totally out of it…


SISSI: You look completely lost, William, how come?


WILLIAM: I’m not lost, we’re at the track, right?


SISSI: Huh?


ODD: Uh-oh- trouble at 12 o’clock.


SISSI: You’re off your rocker-
You ought to go talk to the nurse at the infirmary.


YUMI: It’s nothing serious-
He’s a little out of sync because he’s a- he’s in love!


SISSI: Wait a second!
Are you trying to say that you and William are-


YUMI: They say that love is like um- getting drunk.


William doesn’t drink of course, he’s just-


SISSI: Just a complete halfwit, right?


JIM: Tenth-graders!
That’s it for today!


Ninth-graders, get on your mark!
Move it!


SISSI: I think something weird is going on…


YUMI: That was a close call with Sissi today…


AELITA: I don't think she bought the love story
between you and William.


ULRICH: Can't we upgrade the quality of William's clone?


JEREMIE: Sorry, like I said- his stupidity-
an unforeseen emerging factor beyond our control.


To fix it, I'd have to reprogram everything.
We're just gonna have to keep improvising.


YUMI: If we can…
Sissi's getting very suspicious.


Think of what'll happen if she tells her father about William.


JEREMIE: Well then, in that case-
The only solution I can see is…


to keep pretending you're in love!


YUMI: What?!


AELITA: Yeah!


Perfect- if you're always hanging out together,
then no one could get near him!


ODD: You've got a very vital mission.
You've gotta keep our secret safe.


JEREMIE: Anyway, I did improve the security program
for the tower that runs William's clone.


Aelita, how would you like to go to Lyoko
to install it after class?


AELITA: No problem.


Who’s going with me?


ULRICH: Do all of us have to go?


JEREMIE: Just one of your will be enough
to keep an eye on things with Aelita.


ODD: I volunteer!


And I also happen to have a fantastic idea!


ULRICH: Uh-oh…


ODD: Why don’t we take Kiwi to Lyoko this time?


JEREMIE: Your brainless dog?


But what for?


ODD: Ah- first of all, my dog in not brainless.


Secondly, our natural talents are multiplied on Lyoko.


Imagine Kiwi and his sense of smell-
He could sniff out monsters from miles away!


He might even be able to sniff out William on the network!


JEREMIE: No way, Odd!
Besides, Kiwi’s such a coward,
he’d take off the second he saw a kankrelat!


ODD: Oh yeah?
As fast as you did the time you went to Lyoko?!


DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)


ODD: Shh, quiet!


JEREMIE: What happened in here?


ODD: Looks like some bikers used ourfactory for training.


AELITA: Anyway, they don’t seem to be here anymore…


SISSI: Coast is clear…


Hm…


Hey William, we’ve gotta talk!


This thing with your and Yumi is baloney, right?


Everyone knows she’s mad about Ulrich-
Who’s mad about me!


WILLIAM: Who, Ulrich Stern?
He’s a nice guy- I like him a lot.


SISSI: You think that Ulrich Stern is a nice guy?
Then you are not well at all.


There are some weirdo things going on
that I think my father ought to know about.


YUMI: Hey Sissi, what are you doing in my boyfriend’s room?


SISSI: Don’t think you can snow me, Yumi!
What has your gang done to William?


YUMI: (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)


Nothing at all!
You’re imagining things!


And now, if you don’t mind,
we’re gonna take a walk down lover’s lane.


WILLIAM: Great guy- Ulrich.


SISSI: Hmm…


JEREMIE: Are you ready?


AELITA: {\i1}Ready to go.


JEREMIE: Odd, are you ready?


ODD: Hang on- don’t rush me, huh?


Okay, ready to go Einstein.


JEREMIE: Odd, is that you making that racket?


ODD: Uh yeah- my tummy’s rumbling.


{\i1}Would you believe it?
{\i1}I’m still hungry!


JEREMIE: Don’t worry, this won’t take very long.


ODD: Once you’re on Lyoko, you’re gonna be a big star.


JEREMIE: Transfer Aelita.


Transfer Odd.


Scanner Odd.


Virtualization.


JEREMIE: {\i1}The tower you want is just behind you.


AELITA: Expecting someone?


ODD: Get ready for a big surprise, princess-


AELITA: Well, what is it?


ODD: Uh, nothing.
I was just kidding.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Head for the tower, Aelita!


AELITA: I’m on my way!


ODD: I’ll stand guard here, okay?


AELITA: I’m starting the installation process, Jeremie.


ODD: I hope I didn’t mess up…


WILLIAM: Where are we going?


YUMI: Nevermind- just keep running!


ODD: Jeremie, I hear some kind of noise.


JEREMIE: Hang on- you’re right.
Two tarantulas just appeared.


For now, they’re at the other end of the sector.


I’m sending you the overboard just in case.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Knock it off, Odd!
{\i1}The tarantulas are far away, but still!


ODD: I can’t seem to keep my balance!
What’s wrong with me?


{\i1}Whoa!


AELITA: Okay Jeremie, the program’s operational.


But where did Odd go?


JEREMIE: {\i1}He’s busy clowning around somewhere…


Now that you’re done, I’ll bring you both in.


Materialization!


ODD: What’s going on around here?


Whoa!


AELITA: Having trouble standing up?


ODD: There’s no way I could have been- oh no!


JEREMIE: Is something wrong?


AELITA: No biggie, Jeremie.


Odd just missed his snack time
and it doesn’t seem to agree with him.


YUMI: What a pest that Sissi is!


JEREMIE: Yes Yumi?


YUMI: {\i1}I’m with William and I can’t get rid of Sissi-
And I’ve got to go home right now!


JEREMIE: Just bring him back to school and we’ll take over.


YUMI: Okay…
Come on Romeo, we’re going home!


WILLIAM: Is Romeo a nice guy too?
I don’t think I know him…


YUMI: Let’s go, I’ll explain on the way.


JIM: Huh?


JEREMIE: Is something the matter, Jim?


JIM: Uh, yeah- something serious!


I spent the last hour looking for my watch!
It must have fallen off after phys ed!


JEREMIE: Huh?


JIM: Della Robbia?


Have you gone mad?


ODD: Uh- is this it, Jim?


ULRICH: Everything go alright?


JEREMIE: Yeah, no sweat.


AELITA: Except that Odd’s acting really weird…


ULRICH: You mean you only just noticed?


DEFAULT: Gross!


ULRICH: Odd, I know you’ll eat anything when you’re hungry,
But that’s ridiculous.


JEREMIE: Ugh, come on Odd!
Get real, what’s wrong with you?


ODD: Huh?
Oh no, this is getting worse and worse


I don’t believe this!


ULRICH: Odd, stop!


JEREMIE: Cut that out!


ODD: It’s well, I got this thing near my back- I think- I…
I think I’m growing a tail.


AELITA: {\i1}Yumi,{\i0} you’ve got to hang out with William’s clone a little longer.


We’ve got… a slight problem.


Here’s Jeremie.


Talk to Yumi.


Listen Yumi, according to my diagnosis,
Odd absorbed Kiwi during virtualization.


YUMI: Is it serious, doctor?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Pretty much,


{\i1}right now his human metabolism is still dominant,
but if we don’t do something fast it’ll be too late.


AELITA: Think we can use the scanners to separate them again?


JEREMIE: I think we can.


We have to send him- um, them, back to Lyoko.


YUMI: Better count me out, I’ve still got that leech on my tail.


JEREMIE: No, I know what to do.
As soon as I get to the factory, I’ll call you back.


YUMI: Yeah, okay.


JEREMIE: Come on, we’ve wasted enough time.
Let’s go!


ODD: Wait- but can’t we eat before we go?!


ULRICH: Wanna eat dog food all your life?


ODD: (BARKS)


ULRICH: Don’t look back, there’s a stray dog following us!


ODD: If you don’t wanna get bitten in the leg,
Better shut up!


Rats, just what we need right now…


ULRICH: you know those guys?


JEREMIE: Uninvited visitors who use the factory as a practice track.


DEFAULT: What are you kids doing here?
Beat it right now!


JEREMIE: {\i1}Let me handle them.


Hello, gentlemen.
We just wanted to go in, that’s all.


DEFAULT: We didn’t see your names on the door,
So get going!


ULRICH: Don’t waste your energy,
they’ve got motor oil for brains.


I’ll take care of this.




DEFAULT: Think you’re in a kung fu flick you shrimp?


ODD: (BARKS)


JEREMIE: He’s mean, you better be careful!
He’ll bite you!


DEFAULT: Hey, Rocky- what’s wrong with him?!


DEFAULT: (YELLS)


ULRICH: What do we do about those guys?


JEREMIE: We’ll worry about them later on,
Right now, we gotta take care of Odd.


AELITA: {\i1}We’re all set, Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Odd, I’m gonna virtualize you as you are onto Lyoko.


Then I’ll restore each of your two DNA sequences,
which should then return to their original molecular state.


ODD: What was that?


ULRICH: You, dogman, go to Lyoko-
He unscrambles you and dog’s DNA-


You and dog come back separated in the scanner.


AELITA: You’re very clever.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Virtualization.


ODD: (BARKS)
It’s like I’ve got the hiccups.


This- gonna take long, Einstein?


JEREMIE: {\i1}I can’t tell you in dog years-
{\i1}It’s pretty complicated so don’t stress me, okay?


{\i1}And don’t go anywhere!


{\i1}If you get devirtualized before I’m finished,
{\i1}It’ll be a dog’s life for you forever.


ODD: Thanks, I feel a lot better now.
(BARKS)


ULRICH: Are you sure we can’t help?


AELITA: Shh, he’s gotta concentrate.


JEREMIE: Oh no, activated tower in the ice sector!


AELITA: We’re on it.


ULRICH: At least we didn’t miss dinner for nothing.
Cool!


JEREMIE: {\i1}Odd, XANA just activated a tower in the ice sector.


{\i1}Ulrich and Aelita are handling it.
{\i1}You stay put, understand?


ODD: Yeah, I get it.
{\i1}Sit, stay, heel, roll over…


JEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.


Transfer Aelita.


{\i1}Virtulaization!


WILLIAM: For XANA!


ULRICH: Nice, the locals came to welcome us.


How about a little overbike action?


JEREMIE: {\i1}You got it.


Bea careful.


AELITA: Hey!


ULRICH: Relax, I won’t run any red lights or anything!


ODD: {\i1}Einstein… you see what I hear?


JEREMIE: Ouch, three bloks just showed up.
Better hide!


JEREMIE: I’ll call Yumi for backup.


YUMI: Well it’s about time you called!
My day’s been just thrilling.


JEREMIE: Major trouble on Lyoko.
{\i1}Better get over here!


YUMI: Hmm…


I get the feeling you forgot about Sissi…


JEREMIE: No problem-
Give me a minute then double time it over here.


SISSI: That you, Dad?


JEREMIE: Elizabeth-


DELMAS: {\i1}Why aren’t you home yet?
{\i1}You should be in your room doing your homework!


JEREMIE: Do you understand?


Now then, hurry on home!


SISSI: But-
Be right there!


YUMI: She’s finally out of my hair!


Well, you know the way back!
Ciao!


WILLIAM: Attack!


AELITA: Ah!


ULRICH: Aelita!


Whoa!


ODD: (BARKS)
Whoops-


Laser arrow!


Oh Kiwi come on!
My front paws aren’t just for running you know!


YUMI: Jeremie, why isn’t the elevator working?


JEREMIE: I shut it off because of those three goons.


{\i1}Are they gone?


YUMI: What three goons?
There’s nobody up here.


JEREMIE: I’ll explain later.


No sign of XANA trouble in town?


YUMI: No.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Good, I’ll switch on the elevator right now.


{\i1}See you in a sec!


DEFAULT: (ENGINES IDLING)


YUMI: Huh?


DEFAULT: (CHUCKLES)


DEFAULT: (ENGINES REV)


ULRICH: Jeremie, I think I just hit a pedestrian.


JEREMIE: {\i1}No time for jokes,
{\i1}Aelita’s in a big jam!


AELITA: (PANTING)


WILLIAM: Attack!


ODD: (PANTING)


Laser arrow!


JEREMIE: Odd, if you get hit just one more time-
{\i1}You’re gonna be in the dog house for good!


ODD: I’d like to see you down here!


JEREMIE: {\i1}Hang in there, the program’s almost finished!


ODD: Where’s Yumi?
I thought she was my backup!


YUMI: (PANTING)


DEFAULT: (ENGINES REVVING)


DEFAULT: (PHONE RINGS)


DEFAULT: She’s up there!


YUMI: Thanks, Jeremie-


ODD: (BARKS)


(GROWLS)
Quit spinning will you?!


ULRICH: No!


AELITA: Energy field!


Ulrich!


ULRICHS: (YELLS)


WILLIAM: (LAUGHS)


JEREMIE: {\i1}Ulrich, Yumi’s not answering!
Something’s not right...


ULRICH: {\i1}Okay, I’m on it!


DEFAULT: (YELLS)


YUMI: (GRUNTS)


JEREMIE: Odd, we’ve got.
I’ve reconstructed your separate DNA sequences.


Now I just have to load it into the scanner’s memory.
It’s done.


Three seconds and you’re to normal!


JEREMIE: {\i1}All you have to do is devirtualize yourself.


ODD: Whew, it’s about time.
My paws are really killing me…


These guys won’t let sleeping dogs lie!


Don’t miss me guys!


I can’t wait to be my old self again.


JEREMIE: Oh no- Odd get out of there!


ODD: Huh?


Shield!


Hey, any more surprises on the way?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Sorry, I didn’t delete the old DNA data from the memory.
{\i1}If I did, it would have bugged.


ODD: Huh?


JEREMIE: Relax, we’ll be back online in two wags of dog’s tail!


ODD: {\i1}I sure hope so.
{\i1}How are the others doing?


JEREMIE: Things could be better.


No news of Yumi,
and Aelita’s alone fighting William and his pals.


ODD: Everything’s falling apart and you want me to
hang out here scratching flees?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Odd, I’m not done yet!
{\i1}It’s too dangerous!


{\i1}Do you hear me Odd?


{\i1}Ugh, you’re about as obedient as Kiwi!


DEFAULT: (FOOTSTEPS)


(EXPLOSION)


ODD: (PANTING)


Whoa!


WILLIAM: (GRUNTS)


AELITA: (YELLS)


JEREMIE: Aelita!


WILLIAM: Super smoke!


ODD: (BARKS)


JEREMIE: {\i1}Odd, no!
{\i1}The DNA data isn’t finished yet!


{\i1}Odd!


ODD: (BARKS)


JEREMIE: Odd!


WILLIAM: No…


ODD: Kiwi?


Oh it is my little diggity dog!
Good boy, yeah!


YUMI: (GRUNTS)


AELITA: Tower deactivated.


ULRICH: Yumi, no!


Yumi, you okay?


YUMI: A bit shaken, but not stirred.


ULRICH: Jeremie?
All’s well with Yumi.


Odd and Kiwi good too?


JEREMIE: No time to celebrate, I’m afraid.


Gotta move those bikers out before they wake up!


KIWI: (GROWLING)


DEFAULT: What’s wrong with that dog?


Has he got rabies or what?


I don’t know but it’s not worth taking any chances!
Let’s roll!


YUMI: Hi everyone!
Sleep well?


ULRICH: No, I didn’t sleep a wink-
Odd was so glad to see Kiwi, they played all night long!


ODD: Kiwi’s talent and my idea of having him
foam at the mouth with toothpaste-


You gotta admit that we’re a great team!


With the two of us on Lyoko- XANA won’t stand a chance!


JEREMIE: I wouldn’t try that again-


AELITA: By the way Odd,
do you always carry toothpaste with you?


ODD: Yeah, you never know when you’re gonna run into a pretty girl.


ULRICH: is feet smell awful enough,
Just imagine him with bad breath as well!


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


SISSI: Yumi!
I know it’s because of you that William’s all messed up!


And I’m gonna prove it!


YUMI: Don’t bother, I know.


SISSI: Ah-ha!


YUMI: I just broke up with him this morning.
Don’t be surprised if he stays messed up for a long time-
He took it pretty hard.


SISSI: You kidding me?!


ODD: You know, I think there’s still a little bit of Kiwi in me.


ULRICH: What, you still got a tail?


ODD: No, his sense of smell.


We’re having beef stew and brussel sprouts for lunch today.


I can smell it from here!


DEFAULT: (LAUGHS)
