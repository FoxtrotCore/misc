72 - Crash Course


ULRICH: Hey, Odd oughta be here already.
We were supposed to play foosball.


YUMI: You know Odd, something probably came up at the last second.


ULRICH: I’ll bet he’s afraid to show up!
If I know Odd, he’s hiding somewhere cause he knows I’ll beat him.


AELITA: (SCOFFS)
If you ask me, it might just be that redhead with braids!


ULRICH: Well what do you know!
Our lady’s man is at it again.


DEFAULT: Hey, yeah!
(GRUNTING)

ODD: Ahh, you know, life isn’t bad at all.


AELITA: I didn’t know you split up with Melanie, Odd.


ODD: Who’s she?


Oh yeah, Melanie, right…
Well uh- She wasn’t very…


Uh, she was just a little too… Well, actually a lot more- well…
You see what I mean?


AELITA: No.


ULRICH: What I see, Odd,
is that you collect girlfriends the way other people collect stamps!


ODD: Hey! I tell you it’s for real this time!


Believe me, Camille, she’s it, she’s the one!
She’s so funny, sensitive, and really cool too.


ULRICH: Yeah, just like all the girls fall for!
(SIPS)


ODD: Maybe, but Camille has something special the others don’t…
Well- she’s crazy about dogs!


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)
ODD: What’s so funny?!


YUMI: And that makes all the difference in the world?


ODD: Yeah, and this afternoon,
we’re going to the movies together.


ULRICH: To see what? {\i1}Wheelchair Zombie 4{\i0} or {\i1}Snorkeling Combat 2{\i0}?


ODD: No way, those days are over.


We’re going to see something real romantic and intellectual.
The picture’s called: {\i1}Petals of Desire{\i0}.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


ODD: The problem with you guys is that you have--
--no sense of romance and no intellect.


ULRICH: Speaking of intellect,
anyone seen Jeremie?


AELITA: Oh, he went back to his room.
I think he’s got a few big problems.


JEREMIE: The only problem I have is our friend, Xana


You remember the last few times he attacked?


ODD: Which time?
The one with the trees or at the swimming pool?


ULRICH: Odd.
We agreed not to bring up that day at the pool, right?


AELITA: Why? What happened at the swimming pool, huh?


ULRICH: Eh- nothing.


YUMI: Hn- nothing at all.


JEREMIE: Whatever! I meant all the attacks--
--Xana has launched recently, okay?


Haven’t you noticed what the target has been?


ODD: Well yeah, us!


JEREMIE: Yes, but especially Aelita and me and it just so happens--
--we’re the only ones who can use the supercomputer.


ULRICH: Come on, we’ve all done it!


JEREMIE: --Following our instructions on the phone but what would happen
if Aelita and I weren’t around to give you guys any help?


Xana wins, hands down, which is why I’m giving all of
you a crash course on using the supercomputer this afternoon.


ODD: What?! No way! Count me out!
I’m going to the movies.


YUMI: And I’ve got a test to study for.


ULRICH: And I’ve got Pencak Silat practice!


JEREMIE: If you guys think you have better things to do,
I can’t force you to come, but then don’t expect us to gain ground on Xana.


YUMI: You’re right, but you know,
some days it isn’t easy being heroes.


JEREMIE: Then listen, we’ll meet up at the computer lab after lunch,
and if you pick it up quickly, it’ll be over in a couple of hours, okay?


ODD: Okay.


AELITA: Uh, Jeremie, I- I can’t make this afternoon…


JEREMIE: Huh?! Why not?


AELITA: Um- I’ve got my audition with the subdigitals.
You know, for the concert?


Today’s the final round of tryouts.


JEREMIE: But that’s impossible!
What if something happens to me while you’re gone?


AELITA: That’s no problem.


While you’re teaching everyone how to run the supercomputer,
I’ll keep my phone on.


If Xana attacks, I’ll be back in no time.


JEREMIE: Okay, maybe you’re right. I worry too much.
Go ahead, I can manage without you.


AELITA: Thanks, Jeremie.


ULRICH: So much for my training session, great--
YUMI: --What about me? I’m gonna flunk another exam for sure!


ODD: That’s nothing- you think you’ve got it bad, huh?
How am I gonna tell Camille that {\i1}Petals of Desire{\i0} is out for today?


ULRICH: Think about it Odd, you’re better off!
You don’t have to pay all that money to sleep through two hours of a film.


ODD: It’s a lot better than sleeping through a class given by our friend Einstein!


JEREMIE: Okay, to start off,
we’re going to go through a little bit of theory.


I’ve printed you up a small list of basic functions to prepare you--
ODD: --Hey hey- wait a minute Einstein!


Wouldn’t it be easier if we just went straight to the practical side?
You tell us what button to push and basta, huh?


JEREMIE: Odd, working the supercomputer isn’t like fooling around in a game console.


Before I can trust you with the controls,
I wanna be sure you know this thing inside-out!


DEFAULT: (GROANS)


JEREMIE: Will you all relax?
You’ll see guys, the theoretical stuff is actually a lot of fun.


ULRICH: Right… It’s gonna be a million laughs…


DEFAULT: (CAR ZOOMING)


AELITA: Eyes on the prize, Aelita.


CHRIS: Aelita! Hello, I’m glad that you could make it!
Let me introduce you to everyone.


You already know Nick and Benoît, my partners.
Sophie- who holds the purse strings.


SOPHIE: Hello, Aelita!


CHRIS: And that big bear in his cage is Simon, our sound engineer.


{\i1}And this Metis and Lise, who are the--
--other contestants for this final audition.{\i0}


AELITA: Hi!


JEREMIE: And so, if we export the virtual memory from the B block into--
--the inertial matrix, you can reconfigure the transfer files.


This will let you delay the alignment of the quantum two-bits.
I’m sure you see where I’m going with this.


Any questions?


ULRICH: Yeah I got one.
How do you expect us to remember all this blah blah junk?


JEREMIE: If you guys were a little more attentive,
you’d have been able to understand it.


YUMI: Ulrich’s right, Jeremie.
Stop trying to teach us everything you know.


Just show us how to do some practical stuff-
like materializing us on Lyoko or programming up the vehicles.


JEREMIE: Okay, fine,
I guess we may as well get to the practical end.


ODD: Huh, are we there yet?


DEFAULT: (FUNKY TECHNO BEAT)


CHRIS: {\i1}Okay Metis, nice one!


ODD: Make sure you hit the right button!
I’m ready, Ulrich.




{\i1}But I don’t want to end up there with four arms and three legs!


ULRICH: Uh, okay.. Umm…
Tran- Transfer Odd. That right?


JEREMIE: Mhm-hm.


ULRICH: Transfer Odd!


{\i1}Scanner Odd!


And uhh…
Virtualization!


ODD: {\i1}Ahh! You turned me into a garden gnome!

ULRICH: OH NO!


ODD: Relax, just kidding.
Everything’s cool here.


ULRICH: (SIGHS)
Not so bad for a beginner, huh?


JEREMIE: Yeah, not bad.


You were confused there for a second and almost--
--hit the wrong button Mr. I-Don’t-Need-Any-Theory.


ULRICH: Oh you’re never satisfied.
Did I get him to Lyoko, yes or no?


JEREMIE: Yes because I was here with you and you--
--weren’t even under the stress of a Xana attack.


Gimme my seat back!


Activated tower: Mountain sector!
Head for the scanners, hurry up!


YUMI: (GASPS)


DEFAULT: (GRUNTS)


ULRICH: Leave him to me!
(GRUNTS)


DEFAULT: (GRUNTS)


JEREMIE: Hey!


YUMI: Oh, Jeremie!


JEREMIE: No!


YUMI: Jeremie!


YUMI: He disappeared…

CHRIS: Well, take our breath away, Aelita.
It’s all yours.


SFX: (FUNKY TECHNO BEAT)


YUMI: He’s still breathing…
But he took a lot of volts.


ODD: {\i1}Hey uh, guys? Remember me?


ULRICH: Odd, I think we’re in a big jam.
Xana sicked a polymorphic specter on us and Einstein’s out cold.


ODD: {\i1}Oh, well then it’s a good thing he showed us how to work the supercomputer.{\i0}


ULRICH: Ah yeah, you’re right! It’s up to us!
Anyone have any idea what to do now?


YUMI: Yes, call Aelita.


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


No answer…
I’ll send her a text message.


ODD: {\i1}Okay, we’ll just have to improvise.
What do I do?


YUMI: Uh, for openers Odd, try and get to the mountain sector.


ULRICH: Yumi, shouldn’t we bring Odd back to Earth,
while we try to get into contact with Aelita?


YUMI: Okay- You know how to rematerialize him?


ULRICH: Uh no, do you?


ODD: No sense arguing guys, I’d rather stay here and fight.
Just tell me where I can find a way tower!


YUMI: Let’s see
Um… a way tower… Oh I know!


To find a way tower you have to bring up--
--a radar window with these two keys!


ODD: {\i1}Hey! What are you doing?! GET IT RIGHT!


YUMI: (GASPS)
ULRICH: Stop it! Hurry up!


ODD: {\i1}Thanks. Well then, plan B.
Try to bring up my overboard.


Maybe I can find that stupid way tower on my own from the air.


ULRICH: Okay, umm… Overboard, overboard…
Darn it! Einstein’s notes are all over the place!


YUMI: I think it’s this one here…


ODD: Well take your time, okay cause I’ve got nothing better to do.
{\i1}Speaking of which, any sign of specter gadget?


YUMI: Yeah, how come he disappeared like that?


ULRICH: Guess he had another date.


YUMI: (GASPS)
Aelita!


The specter must have gone after her!
We have to warn her right away!


See you later!


ULRICH: Bu- Hold on,
you’re not gonna leave me alone like this?


YUMI: You’re doing great,
Ulrich! Just keep it up!


ULRICH: (EXHALES)


ODD: I don’t believe it.
Where is this way tower?


ULRICH: I don’t know… but Odd,
{\i1}you’ve got some thingamajigs heading your way…


ODD: Huh? You’re making progress Ulrich but those--
--thingamajigs are Bloks and they don’t look too friendly!


ODD: Laser arrow!


I don’t believe it! I missed them all!


Okay you monsters cool it!
Ouch!


AELITA: Well, I guess that’s it then.


CHRIS: Okay, thanks a lot to all three of you for that great stuff,
just give us a few seconds to talk it over and we’ll let you know our decision.


AELITA: Oh no!


CHRIS: Aelita has got to be our choice.


SIMON: Oh yeah, no doubt about that.


ODD: Hey where’s my ride?
Are you sending it over or not?


ULRICH: Uhh, I’m working on it.
Let’s see, I um- Oh, there it is! I got it!


ODD: Well try to work faster!


Laser arrow!


ULRICH: Materialization overboard!


ODD: Ulrich!
{\i1}You just sent me the overbike!{\i0}


ULRICH: Uh, sorry Odd. I can’t send you anything else.


ODD: Well, it’s better than nothing.


But there’s another problem: you were supposed to send it to me
Not to them, dummy!


Well I guess it’s up to me to unblock the situation.


Time to saddle up!
Yee-haw!


CHRIS: Welp, Metis, Lise, I’m really sorry guys but-
But where’s Aelita?


AELITA: (GASPS)


DEFAULT: (GROWLS)


AELITA: No!


DEFAULT: (CAR ZOOMING)


AELITA: Let’s move it!


DEFAULT: Um- Are you okay? Nothing broken?
Everything cool?


HEY- THAT’S NOT- AH!


Hey, you okay?


What’d that guy do?


ODD: Hey Ulrich, where is this way tower?


ULRICH: Sorry Odd, I’m afraid to push some of these buttons.


ODD: {\i1}Well you better! I’m starting to roast over here!{\i0}


ULRICH: D’oh, what’s that number doing here?


Great! Yumi! Just in time!
{\i1}I’ve got some sort of countdown window up here...{\i0}


YUMI: Hang on! I got the expert with me!
Here!


AELITA: Ulrich! It’s Aelita!
Is there anything written above the window?


ULRICH: Uh, yeah- it says “Big fat cheesehead”.
What does that mean?


AELITA: It’s a code!


You’ve started a delayed virtualization
{\i1}directly into the mountain sector!{\i0}


YUMI: {\i1}Ulrich, has Odd found the way tower?{\i0}


ULRICH: No, but I just got a mega idea.


YUMI: Ulrich? Ulrich?
Big fat cheesehead?


AELITA: It’s uh… uh- a private joke between Jeremie and me…


SFX: (TIRE SQUEALS)


AELITA: Yumi!


YUMI: That way!


SFX: (TIRE SQUEALS)


ODD: This ice float sure is deserted.


Well, nothing to lose,
Let’s try that tower.


I can’t believe it,
I’m still stuck in the ice sector.


AELITA: Ulrich just virtualized himself into the mountain sector!
Odd!


{\i1}That way tower is just a little further,{\i0}
{\i1}bearing northwest from your position.{\i0}


{\i1}We’ll meet you in the mountain sector!{\i0}
{\i1}Move it!{\i0}


ODD: Well, better late than never.


YUMI: Your turn now Yumi.
Virtualize me!


ULRICH: Uh oh- bingo.


YUMI: Transfer Aelita.


Scanner Aelita.


Virtualization!


I did it!


AELITA: Yoo-hoo!
Guess who?


What’s on the menu?


ULRICH: Usual stuff,
A whole seafood platter over there and William’s the lemon.


ODD: Yahoo!


ULRICH: Well you sure took your time.


ODD: Yeah, but at least I got here
and no thanks to you.


If you knew how many towers I’d been--
--through before I got to the right one--


AELITA: We’re going to need more vehicles, Yumi.
{\i1}Do you read me, Yumi?{\i0}


YUMI: (YELLS)


AELITA: {\i1}Yumi! Answer us!{\i0}

ODD: Transmission problems?


AELITA: No, I think it’s worse.
I’m pretty sure that the specter’s in the computer lab.


ULRICH: Okay, I’ll go. Shoot me Odd!


ODD: No, I should be the one.
I’ve already lost lots of life points, and you still got all yours.


You’d be more useful here.
Whatsmore, that’s exactly what we did during the swimming pool attack!


ULRICH: I don’t ever want to hear--
--about the swimming pool again!


ULRICH: That’ll teach you, huh?
Saddle up, princess.


AELITA: Okay.


This is gonna be a close one.


YUMI: (GRUNTS)


DEFAULT: (YELLS)


ULRICH: Right now!


Impact!

ODD: Yumi, are you okay?


YUMI: I- I didn’t realize you were back…


ODD: Neither did he- but he sure knows now.
We’ve got no time to lose.


He could reform again any second!
Okay don’t move!


YUMI: You think you can virtualize me, Odd?


ODD: Relax! I’m a computer whiz, you know that.


YUMI: Ummmm… not?


WILLIAM: (GROANS)


Super Smoke!


AELITA: (YELLS)


ULRICH: Aelita!


WILLIAM: (LAUGHS)


ULRICH: Whoa-
Super Sprint!


Oh, whew.


WILLIAM: (GRUNTS)


YUMI: What’s this, William?
Another girl catch your eye?


WILLIAM: (GROWLS)


AELITA: Nice one, Odd! Just in time!


ODD: {\i1}Thank you, thank you.{\i0}
That was just a taste of my talent.


Einstein would be so-
That’s funny, I’d have sworn you were taller.


ULRICH: Later, gator.


DEFAULT: (GROWLS)


ODD: (LAUGHS)
Hey! Look up there!


It works most of the time!


WILLIAM: You’re finished Yumi!


YUMI: We’ll see about that!


WILLIAM: No!


SFX: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)


ODD: No!


SFX: (HUMMING CONTINUES)


AELITA: Tower deactivated.


DEFAULT: (GROWLS)


JEREMIE: What happened?


Aelita- the specter- the tower-
Did you- Did you do it?


AELITA: Me? I didn’t do anything.


JEREMIE: I have to say that you guys held your own in the end.


But you have to admit I was right, if Xana attacks Aelita or me now,
I know you’ll be able to take over.


YUMI: So that means you trust us, huh?


JEREMIE: Yeah… Uhh-
A bit…


AELITA: Well that’s good news--
--because the day after tomorrow I’ll be gone all day.


I’ve got my dress rehearsal.
The {\i1}Subdigitals{\i0} chose me to be the opening act for their concert!


Even though I walked out on them-


JEREMIE: That’s fabulous, Aelita! Well done!


ULRICH: Yeah that’s great!
By the way Odd, how was {\i1}Petals of Desire{\i0}?

ODD: Oh, it was lame. What’s more- I broke up with Camille.
I’m over all that romantic stuff.


You know- I’m more into action,
like the day at the swimming pool attack for instance.


YUMI: Odd, don’t talk about the swimming pool, okay?!


AELITA: Hey, don’t tell me you’re never gonna--
--tell us what happened at the pool, huh?


ULRICH: Well...


ODD: Well, it’s simple really, uh, let’s see now-
You remember the attack in the gymnasium?

JEREMIE: Odd! We told you never to bring--
--up the attack in the gym, right?


ULRICH: Why, what happened in the gym?


JEREMIE: Um, nothing really.


AELITA: Mm, nothing at all.
