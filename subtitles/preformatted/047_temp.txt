HERB: This new stuff will get rid of my unsightly zits for sure!


THEO: You should’ve seen them.

DEFAULT: You know, they’re back together again.


ULRICH: Hey, Julian, you mind telling me what you’re studying?


JULIAN: The eye chart. I’m near-sighted, but I don’t wanna have to wear glasses.
That’d be too lame.


ULRICH: Oh, you’re right, being blind as a bat sure is a lot more cool.


Holding up the wall, huh, Odd?


ODD: No, push-ups. Why? Can’t you tell?


ULRICH: No.


ODD: I’m sick of hearing Yolanda tell me I’m scrawny.


ULRICH: But you are scrawny.


ODD: I am not scrawny. I’m… svelte.


SISSI: Ulrich, wanna look over my health record with me?


ULRICH: Uh…


SISSI: Look at my weight curve, just right. And my growth curve? Just right.


Perfection is really wonderful, isn’t it?


JEREMIE: You don’t understand, Aelita. You don’t have a health record. You’ve never
even been vaccinated! What if the nurse finds out that you’re not really human?


AELITA: You mean you don’t find me very human?


JEREMIE: Yeah, sure I do, but… that’s not what I meant.


AELITA: Jeremy, relax, don’t get so carried away.


YOLANDA: Alright. Jeremie Belpois, Odd Della Robbia, and Julian Ksou.


ULRICH: Go on, Rambo, blow ‘em away!


DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)


YOLANDA: You’ve got the heart of an athlete, Odd, but you look a little skinny
to me. Are you sure you’re eating enough?


JEREMIE: By “enough”, do you mean more than an elephant?


ODD: I eat a lot.


YOLANDA: Ah, in that case, it must be your metabolism that keeps you so scrawny.


Okay, your turn, Julian.


ODD: I am not scrawny! I’m svelte!


YOLANDA: Alright, read the top line please.


JULIAN: Uh, A, Q, T, Z!


YOLANDA: Jeremie, what do you see on line one, please?


JEREMIE: H, B, P, Z, and L.


YOLANDA: Really, Julien. Not only are you nearsighted, you’ve got a bad memory,
too.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)


YOLANDA: Jeremie, your turn.


JEREMIE: Ma’am, is it bad if we forgot to bring our health records, and if we haven’t
had all our vaccinations?


YOLANDA: Well, yes, it is. But don’t worry, you’re completely up-to-date.


Elizabeth Delmas and Aelita Stones, please.
 
ODD: Not to worry, Einstein. She thought you were human, didn’t she?


JEREMIE: Hilarious.


DEFAULT: Huh?


JEREMIE: An activated tower!


ULRICH: In the middle of a medical checkup? XANA has no respect for anything.


JEREMIE: Ulrich, stay here and wait for Aelita. Bring her to the factory as soon as
she gets out. Odd and I will head over there now.


JIM: Hey, quit dawdling! This is a 100-meter sprint, not a chorus line!


YUMI: Okay, Jeremie. I’ll be there as soon as I can.


JIM: Next!


Go!


JIM: Yeah, there you go! Someone, at least, is putting their back into it.
Wow, Yumi, you just broke the school record.


But… hey! Yumi!


SISSI: What? Your scale must be broken! That’s five pounds over!


YOLANDA: The scale is perfectly accurate, Elizabeth.


SISSI: It’s Sissi! This is outrageous! I’m going to tell my father!


YOLANDA: I’d run up to his office, if I were you. It might help you lose a few pounds!


Your turn, Aelita.


AELITA: I’m really sorry, ma’am, but I forgot to bring my health record.


YOLANDA: Oh, it’s no big deal. I’ll just put your results on a separate piece of
paper that you can staple into your file later on.


SISSI: I should’ve left my health record at home too.


DEFAULT: (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)


AELITA: But why?


SISSI: Well, can’t you guess? My ultra perfect weight curve has just been wrecked
by these five extra pounds!


AELITA: Well, you can’t tell by looking at you.


SISSI: (SCREAMS)


There! There! The nurse, sh-sh-she… she… she… Aelita!


ULRICH: Okay, I get the picture.


Yolanda has been possessed by XANA!


JEREMIE: She’ll probably try to get Aelita to the factory so she can transfer Aelita
to Lyoko, and then deliver her to the Scyphozoa.


ULRICH: {/i1}I’ll try and stop her!


JEREMIE: Without Aelita, we can’t deactivate the tower!


ODD: How about we block the elevator? That might buy us a little time.


JEREMIE: Okay.


But it’s only gonna give us five or six minutes, no more.


YUMI: So, what do you suggest?


JEREMIE: Well, we could do battle with Yolanda on equal terms.


YUMI: Say what?


JEREMIE: I’ve been studying XANA’s Spectres for a while now. I think I can manage
to pixelize you.


YUMI: You mean you’re gonna turn us into people like the ones possessed by XANA?


ODD: Instead of being XANA-ified, we’re gonna be Jerem-ified. Do you get it, guys?


YUMI: Couldn’t that be a bit risky?


JEREMIE: I could say no, but I’d be lying.

ULRICH: Jeremie, Yolanda is heading for the corridor!


JEREMIE: Hold her off as long as you can!


ULRICH: How much time you need?


JEREMIE: Ideally, about three months, but I’ll see what I can do to speed things up.


ODD: So how do you plan on pixelizing us, Frankenstein?


JEREMIE: First step, activate a tower.


YUMI: You know how to do that?


JEREMIE: Well, uh… theoretically, uh, yes.


It doesn’t work!


YUMI: Yes, it does! Look!


JEREMIE: I, uh… I activated a tower! Now, thanks to this activated tower,
I’m gonna send a digital impulse which will travel at hyperspeed


through all the networks and gather huge amounts of energy.
I’ll guide it by remote control towards the exit I choose, like the cables


on my screen, and the impulse will come out as a Spectre.


ODD: Uh, English translation, please?


JEREMIE: Well, I’m gonna send a Spectre, and you’ll become invincible.


ODD: I’ll do it!


YUMI: Are you sure?


ODD: I’ve got a little score to settle with Yolanda Perraudin.


ULRICH: Excuse me, ma’am, but you forgot to give me my check-up.


And I remembered to bring my health record and everything!


DEFAULT: (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)


ULRICH: Okay, guess my reflexes are pretty good.


How about testing my eyesight now?


AELITA: {/i1}Jeremie!


JEREMIE: Aelita, are you okay?


AELITA: {/i1}Yes, but I can’t get through the corridor!


JEREMIE: We’re coming! Get ready, Odd. This gonna be big time.


ODD: If this ends badly, Jeremie, you promise to look after Kiwi?


JEREMIE: If this ends badly, there will be nobody left to look after Kiwi.


ULRICH: (SCREAMING)


YUMI: Odd? How do you feel?


ODD: Fully charged.


AELITA: Please hurry up, Jeremie, I… she’s here!


ODD: Ha! So, Miss Nurse, do you think I look scrawny now?


This way, nasty nurse! Catch me if you can!


JEREMIE: Aelita, you read me? Aelita?


AELITA: Loud and clear.


JEREMIE: Aelita, are you okay?


AELITA: I’m alright.


YUMI: What about Ulrich?


ULRICH: Here I am.


Am I dreaming, or has Odd turned into a superhero?


YUMI: Jeremie’s managed to Jerem-ify him.


ULRICH: Oh yeah? That’s weird.


JEREMIE: Yeah, but I don’t know how long he’ll last against Yolanda,
so we have to deactivate the tower that’s controlling her.


ODD: Better and better.


JEREMIE: Scanner, Ulrich!
Scanner, Aelita!


Scanner, Yumi!
Virtualization!


The Overbike and Overwing are on the way.


{/i1}The activated tower is above the forest in front of you.


YUMI: Let’s move!


ULRICH: Any news from Odd and his private nurse? Last time I checked,
the atmosphere was electric.


JEREMIE: {/i1}He should be hanging in there. For now, that is.{/i0}
But you guys better be careful. XANA’s sent out some monsters


to stop you from reaching the tower!


ULRICH: Wow, isn’t that a surprise.


ODD: Uh-oh.


{/i1}Jeremie, I’m losing power, is that supposed to happen?


JEREMIE: Uh…


ODD: {/i1}That’s what I thought.{/i0}
You’re using your I-hate-to-say-it-but-you-bombed-the-exam voice.


JEREMIE: Odd? Odd, can you hear me? Odd!
{/i1}Odd! Odd, can you hear me?


Yumi, can you hear me?


YUMI: Yes, Jeremie?


JEREMIE: {/i1}It’s about Odd. We’ve got a big problem.


YUMI: Yeah, well, it’s not too easy at this end, either.


JEREMIE: Listen, XANA is taking control of the tower I activated for Odd and
there’s nothing I can do to stop him.


ULRICH: Whenever you and Odd start messing around, that means trouble for us.


YUMI: But how is that gonna affect Odd? Will XANA take control of him too?


JEREMIE: Well, it looks as if he’d rather just pump all of his energy.


YUMI: {/i1}You mean… until he…


JEREMIE: Yeah.


YUMI: Where’s the other tower?


JEREMIE: {/i1}In the mountain sector. There’s a waytower to the west.


YUMI: Got it. I’ll go with Aelita. Saving Odd is top priority now.


ULRICH: I’ll stay here and clean up.


JEREMIE: Yumi, Aelita, hurry up! Odd doesn’t have much time left!


Okay, ladies, the tower’s dead ahead of you, can you see it?


YUMI: {/i1}Uh, no. To tell you the truth, we can’t see anything.


AELITA: XANA had already pulled this one on us.


YUMI: Hey, watch out!


JEREMIE: You’re right at the edge of the cliff. You have to hang on real tight.


{/i1}Now!


Listen to me, okay? I’ll guide you. {/i1}The path leading to the tower
is dead ahead of you, Yumi. Keep walking straight ahead until{/i0}


{/i1}I say stop.


{/i1}Stop!


YUMI: Next time, Jeremie, give me a little more warning, okay?


JEREMIE: {/i1}Sorry! I can’t judge distances very well on my screen. Now, turn right.


YUMI: {/i1}What’s XANA got in store for us next?


JEREMIE: You’re gonna have to go around a rock. The best solution, as I see it,
is to go around to the left.


YUMI: Jeremie? Are we there yet?


JEREMIE: After the rock, it’s straight ahead to the tower. You’re almost there!
Oh no!


YUMI: {/i1}What?


JEREMIE: You’ve got company. Hornets.


YUMI: Where?


JEREMIE: Duck!


{/i1}Watch it!


{/i1}Okay, run straight ahead to the tower!


ODD: (WHIMPERING)


YUMI: Where are they, Jeremie?


JEREMIE: {/i1}I don’t see them... aha, I do now! They’re diving down straight at you!


{/i1}Aelita, run to the tower!


Hurry up!


{/i1}You’re in front of the tower!


YUMI: Spotted.


Jeremie, any news from Odd?


JEREMIE: No.


YUMI: {/i1}Aelita’s coming out of the tower, we’re going back to Ulrich right away!


JEREMIE: Okay, I’ll program the Overboard for you.
Ulrich, do you read me? Aelita and Yumi are on their way to you.


ULRICH: Good, the three of us could use a few ladies around here.


The girls are coming, we’d better clean up!


Fusion!


It’s about time. I was getting a little lonely out here by myself.


YUMI: What about the monsters?


ULRICH: What monsters?


ODD: It was pretty rude of you to have left me there in the middle of our conversation,
Nurse Yolanda.


JEREMIE: Oh, Odd, am I glad to see you!


ODD: Yeah, I’m glad to see me too.


ULRICH: It’s getting pretty hairy over at the factory. 


AELITA: Tower deactivated.


ODD: I really think XANA needs to work on his bedside manner, don’t you?


JEREMIE: [LAUGHTER]


SISSI: Yolanda turned into this weird, super scary demon and jumped out of the window!
That’s what happened!


JIM: Reminds me of when I worked at a psychiatric hospital.


MR. DELMAS: You worked at a psychiatric hospital?


JIM: I’d rather not talk about it.


SISSI: But it’s the truth, I tell you!


MR. DELMAS: Listen, Sissi dear, stop this nonsense and tell me what really happened!


DEFAULT: [DOOR OPENING]


ULRICH: Why don’t you ask Yolanda?


MR. DELMAS: Oh.


SISSI: Hmph.


AELITA: Mrs. Perraudin wasn’t feeling very well, so she went out for some air.


MR. DELMAS: Out the window?


AELITA: Uh… yes, of course. Why not?


MR. DELMAS: Is that really what happened, Yolanda?


YOLANDA: Well, uh, yes, uh… I-I mean, I don’t really remember. It’s as though I
blacked out. But I don’t see why Aelita would want to lie.


JEREMIE: Nice one, Aelita. You were perfect.


ODD: You know, anybody that lies that well could only be human. Right, Jeremie?


ULRICH: (LAUGHTER)


SISSI: Hold it!


I am not crazy! There are some super weirdo things that happened
in that infirmary!


JEREMIE: Relax, Sissi. We understand how it’d make you crazy to be five
pounds overweight.


SISSI: Ugh! I am not five pounds overweight!


ODD: No, no, come on, don’t worry! You know, nobody’s perfect!


SISSI: Speak for yourself, scrawny!


ODD: I am svelte!
