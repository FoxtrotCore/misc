82 - Distant Memory


AELITA: {\i1}Look at my giant snowball, mommy!


AELITA’S MOTHER: {\i1}Stay near the house, darling!


FRANZ: {\i1}Well done, my angel!


AELITA: {\i1}(LAUGHING)


DEFAULT: {\i1}(HOWLING)


AELITA: {\i1}Mommy! Daddy!


{\i1}Nooo!


AELITA’S MOTHER: {\i1}Aelita!


{\i1}Aelita!


AELITA: {\i1}(PANTING)


{\i1}Mommy!


{\i1}Mommy!


{\i1}Nooo!


AELITA’S MOTHER: {\i1}Aelita…


AELITA: {\i1}Mommy!


{\i1}Mommy…

YUMI: What? You’re still having nightmares?


AELITA: Well, yeah.


They keep coming back every now and then
And what’s more- they’re always the same.


But don’t worry, Jeremie, I’m used to them.


JEREMIE: No, Aelita, it’s not your nightmares I’m worried about.


AELITA: I told you that it’s no big deal.


Yumi won’t be far for the holidays and I’m staying here
To keep an eye on XANA so there’s no need to worry.


JEREMIE: I don’t care about XANA.


I just don’t like leaving you here all alone.


I’m gonna tell my dad I’m staying here.


AELITA: No you’re not.


You should spend the holidays with your families.


For me, it’s… it’s not the same thing.


ULRICH: At holiday time my dad gets more stressed out than ever
Which makes my mom hysterical.


I think I’d rather stay here.


ODD: Yeah, me too.
My sisters drive me nuts.


Last year, they locked me in the bathroom all night
Just because they thought it was funny.


YUMI: They did?
But- that’s even worse than my kid brother.


I thought they were older than you, Odd.


ODD: They are, and they’re a lot bigger than me too.
That’s my problem.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


AELITA: Hey Ulrich, isn’t that your dad’s car over there?


ULRICH: Well, the show must go on.
See you soon, everybody.


ODD: May the force be with you!


JEREMIE: See ya!


YUMI: It’s not all that long.


AELITA: Try and have some fun.


JEREMIE: There’s my father.


Aelita, are you sure that you-


AELITA: Come on now, hurry up!
I won’t be all alone- I’ve got Kiwi for company!


JEREMIE: Okay, goodbye for now.


ODD: Alright, speaking of Kiwi-
Don’t feed him any cheese at all. It gives him gas.


And that’s more powerful than your energy fields.


AELITA: (LAUGHS)
Thanks for the tip!


JEREMIE: {\i1}Hi dad!


ODD: {\i1}So long!


MR. STERN: I see you’re still hanging around
That gang of good-for-nothin’s.


ULRICH: And I see you forgot your happy pill again.


MRS. STERN: Ulrich!


MR. BELPOIS: Your friends seem very nice, Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Uh- yeah, I really like them a lot.


They’re my good buddies.


MR. BELPOIS: That girl with the pink hair- Is that Aelita?
The one you’re always talking about?


She’s very pretty- and I get the impression she likes you.


YUMI: I’d better go-
I promised my mom I’d help her clean up.


AELITA: Okay yeah-
See you, Yumi!


YUMI: Aelita, are you sure you don’t want to spend the holidays with us?


I’ll call my parents and tell them-


AELITA: No, I’d just be in the way.
And besides, I could use a little time alone.


YUMI: Hmm.


Well, if you need anything, you know my number.


AELITA: Okay, have a nice holiday!




{\i1}Oh he’s so cute- I love him!


{\i1}What should I call him?


FRANZ: {\i1}How about Mister Pück?
{\i1}It’s the name of an elf.


AELITA’S MOTHER: {\i1}Do you like it?


AELITA: {\i1}Oh yes!
{\i1}Thank you, Mommy!


MR. BELPOIS: (WHISTLING)


You’re very quiet, son.
Is anything wrong?


JEREMIE: Uh no, it’s nothing-
I was just thinking of something else.


MR. BELPOIS: Ah…


You disappointed me again as usual, Ulrich!
I thought after the talk we had last month


That you would try at least and make some kind of effort!


Instead, there’s been no improvement at all!


Plus, all those unexcused absences!


ULRICH: (LAUGHS)


MR. STERN: And you find that amusing…


AELITA: Hm?


DEFAULT: (PIANO “TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR”)


AELITA: Daddy?


Where are you?


“Expecting you here on Lyoko-”


You’re not on the network?


Oh rats, it bugged up!


MRS. ISHIYAMA: Yumi, could you please give me a hand in here?


YUMI: Soon as I’m finished calling my friend!


MRS. ISHIYAMA: Your phone call can wait!
I need you to help me right now, if not


I’ll never finish all the housework in time!


YUMI: But Mom, you’ve got a whole week to do it!


MRS. ISHIYAMA: Yes, and as usual your father’s not going to lift a finger
So a week may not be enough!


MR. ISHIYAMA: Huh? What did I do this time?


YUMI: Ugh!


AELITA: “There isn’t much time…”


Not much time for what?


“Here are the coordinates…”


“See you in a minute, my dear.”


FRANZ: {\i1}See you in a minute, my dear.


AELITA: What’s that thing?


A simulation bubble?


Huh?


How can this be?!


FRANZ: Hm?


AELITA: Daddy?


FRANZ: Aelita!
We’ve so much catching up to do… and there’s so little time…


AELITA: I thought you were lost on the network!


FRANZ: Lost? No dear…


When XANA destroyed Lyoko, I managed to escape.


I have information to give you,but first,
I wanted so much to hold you in my arms…


AELITA: But how did you-


FRANZ: I had to create this simulation bubble so that I could finally-


AELITA: This is so fantastic!
Everything is just the same…


FRANZ: Yes, the bubble will allow us to do many things, my dear...


Like spending an evening together, at last.


YUMI: Aetlia, come on- pick up, will you?


HIROKI: {\i1}Hi-yah!


YUMI: Hey! What are you doing in here?!
Get out!


HIROKI: Calling Ulrich?


YUMI: Mind your own business!
Do I ask you about Milly Solovieff?


HIROKI: (GROWLS)


YUMI: Hello Jeremie?


JEREMIE: For how long of a time?


Her phone battery might be dead, that’s all.
Think you can go over there and check it out?


Keep me posted, okay?


Uh, Dad?
I forgot my laptop back at the dorm and I, um…


MR. BELPOIS: I get the idea, Jeremie.


Your laptop wouldn’t have pink hair by any chance, would it?


JEREMIE: Huh?


MR. BELPOIS: You know, I can understand that.
I was in love once too.


JEREMIE: You were, with who?


MR. BELPOIS: Who else? With your mother!


MR. STERN: Oh this traffic’s horrible!


MRS. STERN: Getting all tense won’t get us there any faster, dear.


ULRICH: That you, Jeremie?


You sure?
You’re right, something must be up.


Okay, I’ll let him know and we’ll meet you-know-where.
Anything is more fun than this.


MR. STERN: Ulrich!
Where are you going?!


ULRICH: To get a little air and to stretch my legs.
Besides, I’ll get there faster if I walk.


See ya.


ULRICH: Odd, Aelita’s not answering her phone!
Meet us at the factory!


ODD: Okay, be right there-
Soon as I tell my parents.


DEFAULT: Well, are you flying today or not?


ODD: Just a second!


Hello? Adelle? It’s Odd. Uh-huh.
Oh, sorry Pauline.


Hey listen, you think you could ask Elizabeth to tell Marie
To say to Louise that she should let Mom and Dad know I missed my flight.


Huh? What do you mean tell them myself?
Hello?


Okay, change of plan…


Nothing like sibling loyalty!


YUMI: Aelita?


“Expecting you here on Lyoko”?


FRANZ: No, as long as XANA hasn’t been defeated,
I can’t rematerialize myself.


But you, however, should be able to free your young friend.
What was his name again?


AELITA: William.


FRANZ: Yes, of course.


I’m gonna send a program to Jeremie via the supercomputer-
By the way, how’s your fight against XANA progressing?


AELITA: We’re hunting him down on the network
thanks to our virtual ship, the Skidbaldnir.


FRANZ: The Skidbladnir?
What a strange name.


AELITA: But you know that name-


It’s in the book of “Viking Legends” that you used to read to me
Before I went to sleep!


FRANZ: Yes, of course!
The Skibladnir, how could I forget?


JEREMIE: Thanks, Dad!


Yumi?


YUMI: Huh? Hurry Jeremie!
Aelita virtualized herself onto Lyoko!


JEREMIE: What?!
But why did she do that?


YUMI: Her father asked her to.


JEREMIE: Hm?


FRANZ: Is something wrong my precious?


AELITA: Why’d you ask me to come to Lyoko, Daddy?


FRANZ: Because I wanted to see you!
It’s been such a long time.


AELITA: It’s dangerous, XANA could attack at any time…


FRANZ: Not as long as I’m with you.


AELITA: You know, when I said that everything here--
was the same as I remembered it, I meant it.


FRANZ: I’m glad you like it.
I wanted you to feel as if it was your home, our home.


AELITA: It’s true, everything’s here- nothing’s missing…
Except for one little thing…


FRANZ: Oh really? What’s that?
But-


You remember dear, your mother disappeared.


AELITA: Yes, and I want to see her again
more than anything else in the world


And you know that- you’ve always known.


And since you’re a perfectionist,
you’d have recreated her in the simulation bubble.


That is… unless you weren’t really my father!


FRANZ: Aelita!


AELITA: Stay away from me, XANA!


WILLIAM: Hello, Aelita.


JEREMIE: Something’s fishy…


YUMI: What if it was Hopper who contacted Aelita?


JEREMIE: XANA’s pulled this on us before.
I don’t think Hopper would risk this with his own daughter.


Aelita is somewhere in the ice sector.
Huh? In a simulation bubble?


YUMI: She’s in a what?


JEREMIE: A copy of the real world-
A sort of ghost channel.


Aelita’s fallen into a trap.
Get ready, you’re going in right now!


WILLIAM: Better give up Aelita, you can’t beat me!


AELITA: That’s what you think!


WILLIAM: What are you waiting for?
Go after her!


JEREMIE: {\i1}Transfer Yumi!


Scanner Yumi.


{\i1}Virtualization!


YUMI: Jeremie, I didn’t land inside the bubble.


JEREMIE: I know, I can’t virtualize you directly inside of it.
You’ll have to find your own way in.


YUMI: Any idea how?


JEREMIE: Uh, not really, but if you ask me-
XANA’s probably screening his guests.


YUMI: For sure-
He even left a couple of bouncers at the door!


DEFAULT: (ROARING)


WILLIAM: (LAUGHING)


JEREMIE: Be careful, Yumi!
That’s 20 life points you just lost.


Perfect timing, you two.
Head straight for the scanner room.


Yumi and Aelita are in big trouble.


ULRICH: Sure, but how ‘bout a little rundown?


JEREMIE: I’ll fill you in later, now get going!


ULRICH: Huh?


AELITA: (PANTING)


DEFAULT: (GROWLING)


WILLIAM: Impossible to escape.


This bubble is your prison.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Virtualization!


ULRICH: Super sprint!


YUMI: Good to see you again.


How was your vacation?


ULRICH: Short, good to be back though.
Where’s Aelita?


YUMI: Somewhere inside that bubble thing…


ODD: She’s always got to be different, doesn’t she?


Laser arrow!


WILLIAM: (LAUGHS)
Give up, Aelita!


AELITA: Alright…


You win, William.


WILLIAM: Eh?


No!


It doesn’t matter.
You’ll lose no matter what, Aelita.


AELITA: Not yet!


ULRICH: Impact!


JEREMIE Huh?


{\i1}The simulation bubble disappeared.
{\i1}Go and help Aelita- step on it!


ODD: Okay, Einstein.
Can you call us some taxis?


JEREMIE: Coming up.


ULRICH: A blok!


YUMI: What was it, Jeremie?


JEREMIE: {\i1}A blok.


YUMI: Ugh!


ODD: Guess we’d better {\i1}unblok{\i0} the situation!


ULRICH: First priority is getting Aelita back!


ODD: Here we go!


WILLIAM: Manta!


Attack!


ULRICH: Flying manta! Watch out!


WILLIAM: You want to leave?


Be my guest.


AELITA: Help!


Ah!


JEREMIE: Aelita, no!


ULRICH: She’s too far away, Jeremie.
Better bring her in!


JEREMIE: I don’t believe it!


AELITA: (SCREAMING)


ULRICH: No!


JEREMIE: Oh no!
This can’t be happening- not Aelita!


YUMI: Yumi… Aelita’s gone…


ULRICH: (YELLING)


ODD: Okay, Romeo- this is really gonna cost you!


WILLIAM: Super smoke!


ULRICH: What’s he doing now?


Looks like he’s waiting for something…


JEREMIE: {\i1}I don’t know…
{\i1}Without Aelita it’s all over…


Hm?


ODD: Einstein!
Something weird is happening!


JEREMIE: {\i1}Yeah, hang on…
{\i1}I think I get the picture…


ULRICH: Huh?


WILLIAM: Victory!


YUMI: Hey, what is that thing?


JEREMIE: It’s what I thought- I was right.


WILLIAM: Fire!


ULRICH: Jeremie, XANA’s trying to destroy a kind of brightly-lit bubble!
What do we do?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Protect it!
{\i1}That bubble is…


{\i1}Franz Hopper!


ULRICH: I’ll handle William.


ODD: Okay, then I’ll go and do a number on that blok!


WILLIAM: Hm?


Super smoke!


YUMI: It looks like he dropped something off…


JEREMIE: You’re right he did!
It was Aelita!


AELITA: Daddy?


ODD: Laser arrow!


It’s great to see you again, princess!


JEREMIE: Hopper’s losing energy!


Take out that blok- and make it snappy too!


ODD: We’re doing all we can, Einstein.


WILLIAM: Hm?


AELITA: Energy field!


WILLIAM: Super smoke!


JEREMIE: It’s all over…


AELITA: Daddy, you have to get away- hurry!


WILLIAM: No!


AELITA: Hi.


ODD: Saying you gave us a scare is an understatement, princess.


ULRICH: I know someone who’s gonna be really happy to see you.
Let’s go.


ODD: I hope this time he gives us the rundown he promised us,
Because I don’t know what’s going on.


JEREMIE: It’s pretty obvious.


ODD: There he goes again.


JEREMIE: You see, when Lyoko was destroyed,
Hopper wasn’t spread out over the network.


He managed to escape.


YUMI: He disappeared on purpose, is that it?


JEREMIE That’s right- to get away from XANA.
Which is why he’s constantly trying to throw Aelita


Into the digital sea all the time.


He knows that’s the only thing
that can get Hopper to come out of hiding.


ULRICH: In order to destroy him.


AELITA: As long as my father’s alive, he’ll always be a big threat to XANA.


JEREMIE: And our friend, XANA, knows it.


ODD: Well, before we blow XANA away for good,
Why don’t we give each other our presents, huh?


ULRICH: We said we’d wait ‘till after vacation.


ODD: Yeah, I know.
Here, Einstein, this one’s for you!


Since XANA made us come back earlier than expected,
Why wait, right?


JEREMIE: That’s cool, Odd, thanks a lot, but…
What am I supposed to do with it?


ODD: Nothing at all, that’s what makes it fun, don't you think?


ODD: You’re not opening your presents?


ULRICH: No.


In Japan, you never open a present in front
Of the person who gave it to you.


AELITA: Thank you, Jeremie.


JEREMIE: And that isn’t all, Aelita.


Tonight, you’re coming home with me!
My parents want you to stay for the holidays.


AELITA: But I don’t want to bother them…


JEREMIE: It’s no bother at all!
There the ones who insisted.


I’ll give you my room, and I’ll sleep in the living room.
We’ve got a really comfortable couch.


AELITA: What about XANA?


JEREMIE: You know, I’m sure that XANA could use a vacation too.


(LAUGHS)


Whatcha thinkin’ about?


AELITA: About my father…
When he saved me, even in his virtual form...


I could feel his presence.


Like he was holding me in his arms...
