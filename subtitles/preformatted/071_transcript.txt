71 - Maiden Voyage


JIM: {\i1}For those still unfamiliar with the sport, rock climbing is a noble discipline,{\i0} which can carry you to great heights.
A good climber commands both mind and body.


This philosophy was well understood by the famous sherpa Tensing Pong[l] who scaled mount Everest using only his bare hands
thanks to the ancestral techniques still taught today by the buddhist monks from the order of Ki Shi Tsou[m].


And so, don’t forget that only by challenging yourselves can you move mountains, and might I add, climb them.


Belpois, get up there. See if you’re up to the challenge. This will be the practical part of today’s lesson.


Go on.


JEREMIE: (GRUNTING)


JIM: What’s the matter? Pull up with your arms and push off with your legs.
Have you got chewing gum for muscles or what?


JEREMIE: (SHOUTS)


JIM: Of course if the only exercise you get is clicking your computer mouse, you’re not gonna conquer any peaks.


Della Robbia, show your buddy here how it’s done.


AELITA: (SIGHS)


It’s no big deal, Jeremie.


SISSI: Well, sourpuss, having a hard time lifting your brain[n] with those string bean arms?


JEREMIE: Odd, do you mind?


ODD: Aelita, I hate to talk with my mouth full, would you mind taking over?


AELITA: Sissi, you’re head is so full helium, you can float to the top! (LAUGHS)


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


HERB: (LAUGHS) You know, sometimes I wonder if you don’t actually ask for it.


SISSI: Shut up, you dork.


YUMI: What happened this morning?


ULRICH: He had to scale the rock wall in gym.


YUMI: Oh, okay, enough said.


JEREMIE: I don’t believe it. I can’t be that bad in every single sport.


AELITA: Of course not… actually no, you really are lame at anything athletic.


Anyway, who cares. You can’t be a champion at everything.


ODD: C’mon, Einstein, stop sulking. Listen, if you want, we can try scaling the wall together.


JEREMIE: You think I have time for that monkey business? I’ve got too much work to do.


YUMI: That’s for sure. You and Aelita spend all of your time shut up in the computer lab. What are you working on?


AELITA: We’re ironing out the final kinks on the Skid.


ULRICH: You’re still on that? I thought it was done.


JEREMIE: Ulrich, travelling through the network is not exactly like taking a stroll through Lyoko.
And what’s in the digital sea is still a complete mystery.


For all we know, the Skid could disintegrate during its first dive.


ODD: Well that’s reassuring. Uh, you gonna eat that?


JEREMIE: Go ahead.


ODD: Cool!


YUMI: You know Jeremie, we’re gonna have to test it out one day if we want to take on Xana.


MR. DELMAS: Quiet down, please.


I said quiet down.


DEFAULT: Shh! Shh!


(IDLE CHATTER)


MR. DELMAS: Quiet, I said!


JIM: Mr. Delmas said quiet down, that means now!


MR. DELMAS: (CLEARS THROAT) Thank you, Jim.


JIM: That’s alright Mr. Delmas, always glad to help.


MR. DELMAS: Yes of course. In case you’ve forgotten, let me remind you that today is FSRP day,
which stands for Fire, Safety, Risk, and Prevention, and so all afternoon classes have been cancelled.


DEFAULT: (CHEERING)


MR. DELMAS: And so as I was saying children, your classes are cancelled,
but part of this free time will be devoted to a complete building evacuation exercise.


This drill is designed to make absolutely certain that you’re all familiar with our security procedures.


Procedures that you will need to know by heart,
it goes without saying that all access to the buildings will prohibited during the exercise. Therefore-


AELITA: Yumi is right, you know. We’d better make a trial run in the Skid just to see how it works.


JEREMIE: Yeah, but I don’t know if we’re ready yet.


ULRICH: We’ve got to try it out before Xana gets even more powerful.


MR. DELMAS: There will be no exceptions made. Thank you for your attention.


JEREMIE: Well okay. We’ll take advantage of the safety drill to get over to the computer lab.


AELITA: Way to go, Jeremie!


ULRICH: Yeah, cool!


JERMIE: But listen up, this is only a trial run to work out the launch procedures.


ODD: Relax[o], we’ll just dive in, test it, and come back.


JEREMIE: As we all know, Lyoko is made up of five sectors.
These sectors are actually located in the center of some sort of giant hollow sphere.


Imagine a kind of enormous virtual bubble suspended in a sort of liquid element.
This liquid element is the world information network.


YUMI: And the digital sea?


AELITA: The digital sea is a part of the network. It’s a kind of overflow[p] that’s accessible this sort of flood gate.
Xana goes through this flood gate to attack us on Lyoko, and the Skid will use the very same gate to get us out.


ULRICH: And once we’re off Lyoko, what then?


JEREMIE: Well I imagine you’ll be in some kind of immense network of tunnels[q],
but I don’t have enough data to tell you exactly what you’ll find. It’ll be a surprise.


ODD: That’s fabulous, I love surprises. Well, what are we waiting for?


JEREMIE: Hang on, Odd! I haven’t even begun explaining about configuring the parameters of the engines,
or the procedure for transferring virtual mass, or, or…


ODD: Don’t bother, we’ll work it out as we go along. Nothing like hands on experience.


JEREMIE: But-


AELITA: Jeremie, don’t worry, I’ll be right there with them.


JEREMIE: Hm.


{\i1}You there yet? I’ll start up the process.


ULRICH: Ladies first.


JEREMIE: Transfer, Aelita. Transfer, Yumi.


{\i1}Scanner, Aelita. Scanner, Yumi.


Virtualization.


YUMI: It’s okay Jeremie, it’s all quiet here.


JEREMIE: Virtualization.


{\i1}Your elevator is waiting.


YUMI: It’s beautiful, huh?


ULRICH: Fantastic.


ODD: Einstein, we made it to the Skid hanger. Now what do we do?


JEREMIE: Each of you get on a transporter spot.


ODD: Well who’s driving?


AELITA: I am, of course.


JEREMIE: You guys, ready? Energize.


AELITA: Wow, it’s working[r] Jeremie!


Everything’s in place according to plan.


Opening interface.


Cockpit to Navskids, do you read me?


YUMI: Loud and clear, Aelita.


ULRICH: Loud and clear, Aelita.


ODD: Me too! This is cool! It’s like being in a spaceship!


ULRICH: Yeah, but be careful, Odd, this isn’t Galactic Invaders.


ODD: {\i1}Yeah yeah, you’re just jealous because I wiped out three times as many aliens as you did last night.


ULRICH: {\i1}Because you cheated, as usual.


JEREMIE: Okay, if you guys are done blabbering, maybe we can get on with the job?


AELITA: {\i1}Standing by, Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Okay, now, get ready for lift off.


Releasing supports.


AELITA: We have ignition, powering vertical.


For you, Daddy.


Lift off!


JEREMIE: All indicators are go. You guys are good for leaving Sector Five.


AELITA: {\i1}Roger.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Tunnel open in two seconds.


AELITA: It’s working, Jeremie, our Skid is working!


YUMI: {\i1}Great!


JEREMIE: (SIGHS)


ODD: {\i1}Nice work, Einstein!


ULRICH: {\i1}Great job, Aelita!


JERMIE: Good, the test was a success. Aelita, you all set to turn it around? And go back into dry dock?


ULRICH: {\i1}What? No way!


ODD: {\i1}Hey, Einstein, I thought we were supposed to test this thing.


JEREMIE: Yeah, well that’s what we did. We just finished a dry run.


ULRICH: {\i1}A test in the digital sea, otherwise what’s the point?


AELITA: They’re right, Jeremie, if we just stay here in the sky on Lyoko it isn’t much of a trial run.


{\i1}Don’t you want to see what the network looks like?


JEREMIE: (SIGHS)


{\i1}I feel like I’m gonna regret this, but okay.{\i0} Get ready to dive into the digital sea. {\i1}Five minutes maximum.


ODD: {\i1}Yeah!


AELITA: Okay then! Shields, activated. Sonar, activated. Stabilizers online and checked out.
Primary access, clear. Laser generators, online. Cockpit to Navskids, ready for a dive?


ULRICH: Ready.


YUMI: Ready.


ODD: Anytime, Princess.


JEREMIE: (EXHALES)


AELITA: {\i1}Here we go!


JERMIE: Base lab to Skid, do you read me?


Lab calling Skid, Aelita, come in. Answer please!


AELITA: {\i1}Skid to base lab, Jeremie, we’re in the digital sea!


JEREMIE: That’s what I wanted to hear Aelita! I nearly had a heart attack waiting!
(STAMMERING) But I’m okay now!


Holoweb system, online.


{\i1}Well, what does the network look like?


AELITA: It’s… it’s beautiful. I’m sending you a visual, Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Wow…


ODD: {\i1}Yeah, you said it Einstein.


AELITA: Rotation.


JEREMIE: Aelita, engage the turbo prop and the auxiliary engines to break clear of Lyoko’s gravity field, okay?


AELITA: Right, whatever you say.


Turbo propeller engaged.


JEREMIE: (SLURPS) Okay, that’s it you guys. Now head for home.


ODD: {i\1}Aw, can’t we stay here a little longer?


JEREMIE: I said five minutes, Odd.


Aelita.


AELITA: {\i1}Roger, Jeremie. Turning around.


Starboard propulsion engaged.


Bearing 160.


JEREMIE: What’s going on around here?


Aelita, I don’t know why, but I just lost all trace of you on my radar. It might just be a transmission problem.
{\i1}Can you check it out?


AELITA: Jeremie, the navigation system doesn’t respond. There’s a bug in it.


JEREMIE: This can’t be! Without a navigation system {\i1}you’ll never find your way back to Lyoko.
{\i1}You’ll be stuck,{\i0} floating on the network until you use up all the Skid’s {\i}virtual power reserves.{\i0}


YUMI: {\i1}And then what?


JEREMIE: Once the virtual energy is exhausted the Skid’ll break up and you’ll all end up in the digital sea for good!


AELITA: Eternal virtualization. Like my father.


ULRICH: {\i1}Well that’s just great.


ODD: By the way, Einstein, I hope you’ve got a solution, because I didn’t bring my bathing suit.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Yeah, well to get you guys out of there, I have to debug the system.
Except that there are several million codes to crack. By then you’ll all be in the drink. Unless…


ULRICH: {\i1}Unless what?


JERMIE:I’ve got sub programs that just might debug and repair the system.
But I have to go get them from my room, and so I’ll have to leave you guys on your own for just a moment.


ODD: {\i1}Oh, that’s cool, Einstein, you couldn’t have brought this stuff with you?


JEREMIE: Hey, I wasn’t the one who insisted on doing this trial run, Odd. So just cool it, if you don’t mind.


AELITA: It won’t help to get all worked up. Hurry and get your CD-ROM, we’ll wait here.


JEREMIE: Okay, I’ll be right back. Whatever you do, don’t move from there.


ODD: {\i1}Very funny.


{\i1}Weird, it looks like an upside-down city.


AELITA: If you ask me, all these buildings are the network’s interconnected databases.


Okay, why don’t we turn on some light?


JIM: Belpois! What do you think you’re doing here?
Why aren’t you with all of the other kids in the school yard, huh?


JEREMIE: Darn it, fire safety day, I forgot all about it too, just my luck.


JIM: Go on, hurry up. The principal sees you here, he’s gonna ring my bell.


JEREMIE: (STAMMERING) Yeah, but, I need to get something from my room, it’ll just take a second.


JIM: Oh no you don’t. You were all warned this morning,
and a warning in hand is worth two in the bush league- beat it!


Did I ever tell you about when I fought forest fires?


ODD: {\i1}Hey, you think we’ll live to see the light of day?


AELITA: Don’t worry, Odd, Jeremie will find a way to fix it, I’m sure.


YUMI: {\i1}By the way, has anyone noticed the change in the light?


AELITA: {\i1}You’re right, that’s strange.


JEREMIE: (EXHALES)


Hm.


Another teacher standing guard, what is this, Fort Knox?


MR. FUMET: Hm?


JEREMIE: Well, there isn’t any other way.


ULRICH: Hey, you guys see that dark thing up there?


AELITA: Yes, I’ll shut the lights to get a better view.


YUMI: {\i1}Aelita, you think that’s Lyoko?


AELITA: I don’t know, but whatever it is, its gravity is pulling us towards it.


JEREMIE: This is not gonna be a piece of cake.


Okay, let’s do it.


Whoa!


(EXHALES)


(SHOUTS)


ODD: {\i1}Whew, I’d love to see that paper-pusher Einstein’s face when he figures out
{\i1}that we didn’t need his help to come back in.


ULRICH: {\i1}Yeah, it’s nice to be back on Lyoko.


AELITA:But it’s not Lyoko.


DEFAULT: Huh?


ULRICH: What?


AELITA: It’s not Lyoko.


Hang on now, retro breaks!


JEREMIE: Who said climbing can take you to great heights? (GRUNTS)


I guess I should monkey around more often.


YUMI: {\i1}There’s something else up ahead.


ULRICH: {\i1}Hey look, it’s ugly and uglier. They look like some sort of eels.


ODD: {\i1}I never met an eel I didn’t like!


AELITA: Heads up, I’m breaking off.


ODD: I’ve seen spiked heels, but spiked eels? Never.


DEFAULT: Hey, hey!


JERMIE: Sorry, got my own fire to put out!


ODD: Holy cow, Aelita, be careful, you’ll get us all killed. You taught you how to pilot?


AELITA: You did, Odd.


ODD: {\i1}Oh.


DEFAULT: {\i1}Whoa!


YUMI: {\i1}Aelita, we’ll never make it against these monsters!


AELITA: {\i1}I know! We’re almost out of energy.
{\i1}The Skid could disintegrate at any moment if Jeremie doesn’t get back soon.


JEREMIE: Okay, Aelita, I’m here in the computer lab, how are you holding up?


AELITA: {\i1}We’re in big trouble Jeremie. Xana’s attacking us{\i0} with some kind of fish…
{\i1}some kind of giant moray or conger eels. Have you started up the debugging program?


JEREMIE: Yes, but you’re burning way too much power and if this continues
you guys’ll be gone before the debugging’s done. We have to buy some time.


AELITA: Okay, but how?


JEREMIE: Get those Kongres off your tail. And then launch the Navskids.


ODD: What? We’re gonna fight them one on one?


JEREMIE: {\i1}Exactly, Odd, just like in Galactic Invaders.


ODD: Okay, bring ‘em on!


AELITA: Are you all set? Navskids away.


ODD: Hey, these are more maneuverable than the overboards! Gangway!


JEREMIE: Now, be really careful, if you get hit, it means you’ll be lost at sea!


ODD: Gotcha Einstein!


Fire torpedos!


{\i1}Unbelievable. It’s up to you, Yumi.


YUMI: They’re tough customers.


ODD: {\i1}You said it.


ULRICH: {\i1}Yumi, behind you!


YUMI: Okay, come and get me… now!


{i\1}Got him!


ULRICH: Nice one, Yumi, you get better and better.


YUMI: Maybe, but not good enough.


JEREMIE: Careful. Don’t forget that the Navskids’ autonomy is limited.


YUMI: {\i1}We’ll do what we can, Jeremie, but these monsters are hard to hit.


JEREMIE: Well don’t try to work any miracles.


Just keep them away from the Skid.


ULRICH: {\i1}Right.


Hey, fish freak, looking for some more bait?


(EXHALES)


This time, I lost him.


JEREMIE: The program is debugged. I’m sending you your coordinates. Get out of there and fast.


AELITA: Navskids in.


Maximum propulsion.


JEREMIE: Trial run’s over, everybody, back to dry dock.


I would never have thought that the world information network was a real live ocean.


ODD: Yeah, with fish and everything. Big ones too.


AELITA: To think that my father is in the network somewhere…


YUMI: Yeah, and so is William.


ULRICH: That huge sphere we saw, what was that anyway?


JEREMIE: Another virtual world, just like Lyoko - a Replika that Xana must have created
from the data that he stole from Aelita.


I really wonder what he’s thinking of doing with it.


ULRICH: We’ll go and explore it.


ODD: Yeah!


JEREMIE: Right. But not tonight. The only thing that I feel like exploring is my bed. I’m wiped out.


ODD: You’re wiped out from sitting in your cushy chair? How do you think we should feel then?


JEREMIE: Odd, if I told you what I was doing while you were on the network, you’d never believe me.


ODD: Well lemme take a wild guess, okay? Uh, you did a little rock scaling on the dormitory roof.


JEREMIE: Huh? But how’d you know that?


ODD: Huh?


AELITA: (GASPS)


YUMI: Oh!


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


ODD: You know, Einstein, you can be really hilarious when you wanna be.
Even when you don’t wanna be! (LAUGHS)
