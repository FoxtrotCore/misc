66 - William Returns


MR. DELMAS: I can’t hear you very well Mr. Dunbar.
Are you trying to say that you son William has gone overseas to stay with you,
and that he won’t be attending classes here until you bring him home?


JEREMIE: Yes, that’s correct sir.


MR. DELMAS: I see, but it’s quite surprising that he would leave
without even bothering to tell any of us.


JEREMIE (AS MR. DUNBAR): {\i1} Uhh


JEREMIE: It was a very sudden decision, you know how youngsters can be at this age.


JEREMIE (AS MR. DUNBAR): {\i1} I’m sure your own daughter Sissi is capable of doing the vsame thing.


MR. DELMAS: That’s very possible, yes… but I didn’t realize that you knew my daughter, and by her nickname as well.


JEREMIE: Uhh, that is, well, actually I don’t really know her, obviously, but well you see, William talks so much


JEREMIE (AS MR. DUNBAR): about her, it’s always Sissi this


JEREMIE: and Sissi that, and so it’s almost as if I really did know her!


MR. DELMAS: Ah, I didn’t know that William was such a close friend of Elizabeth.


JEREMIE: Well, Sissi’s a role model for William, an example.
And how could it be otherwise, I mean considering the sort of father that she has.


MR. DELMAS: Thank you Mr. Dunbar, I was delighted to have this little chat with you.
Please give William my best regards, and tell him that we hope
he’ll return to school very soon and that he’ll always be welcome.


JEREMIE: I will tell him. Goodbye Mr. Delmas, and many thanks for your understanding.


MR. DELMAS: You’re very welcome, sir.


JEREMIE: (Whew) I guess I make a good grown up.


AELITA: Yes, but now all we have to do is find William.


JEREMIE: You’re right, we’d better get back to work.


SFX: (BIRDS CHIRPING)


JEREMIE: Piece of cake!


YUMI: Okay, so it worked with the Principal, but what’ll happen when
William’s real parents want to see their son?


ULRICH: Yumi’s right, and I’m not so sure that voice synthesizer of yours
is gonna do the trick, Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Who knows, maybe by then we’ll have localized William.


ODD: How are you gonna do that?


AELITA: Thanks to the data we got from my father before he disappeared into the network,
Jeremie and I have just about recreated Lyoko.


ODD: You’re recreating Lyoko?


AELITA: We may even be ready by tonight.


JEREMIE: That’s right, in fact Aelita and I have worked on it every night for the last week.


ODD: Ah, so that’s why you look like a couple of zombies, huh?
And I thought you looked like wrecks ‘cause you were partying all night,
I was getting jealous.


YUMI: Hi Milly, hi Tamiya, you wouldn’t mind if we sat here with you, would you?


MILLY: Hmph


TAMIYA: Hmph


ULRICH: They still sulking?


JEREMIE: What do you think?


ODD: Well, you did sneak out the bathroom window in the middle of an interview.
And for ace reporters like them that is pretty insulting.


JEREMIE: Being mad at me isn’t as bad as their being really mad at each other.


ULRICH: But how come?


JEREMIE: They had a massive argument over the newspaper, I think.


YUMI: You mean the Kadic News has folded for good? That’s the best news I’ve heard in a-


ODD: No it’s not! How am I gonna know who’s going out with who now?
I guess I’ll have to console myself by watching Jim dancing to old disco music. He really…


SISSI: Hm


HERB: Well personally, out of all the seasons of the year, I like the spring best of all.


NICOLAS: I like summer best because it’s nice and warm.


SISSI: Quiet huh, I can’t hear anything!


HERB: Well if you can’t hear anything then we should speak louder shouldn’t we?


SISSI: Dork, it’s not you I want to listen to!


ULRICH: Odd, don’t tell me you’ve been watching {\i1}Paco The King of Disco{\i0} again.


ODD: I can’t help myself. Whenever I’m in a bad mood, I put the film on.
I don’t know why he’s so ashamed that he used to be an actor.


ULRICH: Most probably because the film was a flop.


HERB: I don’t see what makes their conversation more interesting than ours.


NICOLAS: Yeah, me neither.


SISSI: Well I do, okay?


SFX: (BIRDS CHIRPING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)


SISSI: Come in (music notes?)


MILLY: You wanted to see me, huh Sissi?


SISSI: Mh hm


MILLY: What’s she doing here!?


TAMIYA: That’s what I was gonna say, what’s she doing here?


MILLY: I thought it was me you wanted to see?


TAMIYA: Same here.


SISSI: Well at least you agree on that. It’s not much, but it’s a pretty good start.
And it’s all thanks to me. Which is why, for the good of the Kadic News,
I’ve decided to become the editor in chief!


MILLY: You’ve decided what?


TAMIYA: Who do you think you are?


SISSI: The daughter of the principal. The only person who can stop you from
printing that poor excuse for a paper that you’re so proud of.


MILLY: But you’re not a real journalist!


TAMIYA: She’s right, you don’t even know the meaning of the word “scoop”.


SISSI: Wrong again, little ones, a scoop, huh? How about an enormous scoop?


JEREMIE: I’m all set.


ODD: Mh hm


JEREMIE: Here we go…


SFX: (COMPUTER BEEPING)


ODD: I don’t want to be a party pooper, but there doesn’t seem to be very much happening.


AELITA: The data that my father transmitted wasn’t enough!


JEREMIE: I guess we must have been really crazy to think that we could recreate Lyoko.


YUMI: Hey wait, look at that!


SFX: (COMPUTER BEEPING)


ULRICH: That’s incredible! It worked!


ODD: Aelita, Jeremie, you guys are gods!


JEREMIE: Well almost, but not quite.
For the time being, all we’ve been able to recreate is Sector 5 of Lyoko.
We’ve still got to work to create the other sectors.
But we should be able to do that soon.


YUMI: Okay, but it can wait a night or two. You guys deserve a good night’s sleep.


AELITA: Yes, Yumi’s right Jeremie. We’re going to be needing every bit of our strength
to look for William. We’ll get started tomorrow.


JEREMIE: Ah, yeah… well alright.


ODD: Hey, do you guys want to watch {\i1}Paco The King of Disco{\i0} with me? It’ll take your mind off things.


SFX: (COMPUTER NOISES)


JIM: Hey, what’s this?


ODD: Mmm… A newspaper without much news?


JIM: Hmm


ODD: Lemme see that!
(NERVOUS LAUGHING)


JIM: You promised not to tell anyone. And to think I actually trusted you.


ODD: Jim, I didn’t give your secret away, I swear!


JIM: Hm, mh hm
You must think I’m an imbecile.


ODD: Do you know what Jim’s gonna do to me for this?


SISSI: No, but I can’t wait to find out.
And I’m sure that my readers are dying to know too.


JEREMIE: Sissi, since when have you been involved with the Kadic News, huh?


SISSI: Ever since I made myself editor in chief.
Oh, and since you’re all together as usual, I’d like to ask Yumi a few questions for the next issue.
What are you two waiting for? Come on, we’re rolling!
Well Yumi, our readers would really like to know how you and William are getting along.


YUMI: Uh, W-William? Me and William? I-I don’t know what you’re talking about.


SISSI: Would you rather I ask the same question of William?
He may not be as shy as you are.
As a matter of fact, where is he? The last time I saw him was a week ago.


ULRICH: He’s gone abroad. His father called your father to tell him.


SISSI: Oh, how come you know that, huh?


ULRICH: (STAMMERING)


WILLIAM: Are you talking about me?
All I can remember is being virtualized on Lyoko and being captured by the Scyphozoa.
It’s a blank after that. That is ‘til this morning when I woke up in the factory.
Hey what are you doing Odd, you’re hurting me.


ODD: Just checking to make sure you’re not one of Xana’s ghosts.


JEREMIE: No danger of that, there isn’t any activated tower on Lyoko. William couldn’t have been sent by Xana.


WILLIAM: So you can stop pinching me, Odd.


SFX: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)


YUMI: Anyhow, you’re just in time for a quiz in math.


WILLIAM: Timing, huh, I haven’t studied at all.


YUMI: So? Since when have you ever studied?


WILLIAM: (AWKWARD LAUGHING)


YUMI: (LAUGHING)


ODD: The next problem is explaining William’s sudden return to Delmas.


JEREMIE: Yeah, you said it.
What I don’t get is why, when Lyoko disappeared, William didn’t fall into the digital sea,
it’s really weird. I’d love to know how he managed to escape.


SFX: (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

AELITA: Who is it?


SISSI: Hi Aelita, we’re not disturbing you I hope.
We would really like to do a feature story on your for our next issue.
It’s true that we don’t know a whole lot about you, are you really Odd’s cousin, and well, is it really all that cold in Canada, and why did you suddenly come here in the middle of the year?
Our readers are interested.


DEFAULT: (AWKWARD LAUGHING)


WILLIAM: Can’t you let her study in peace, huh?
Alright, get going, all three of you. You’ve annoyed her enough.


SISSI: Oh, William, you came back! I thought you were overseas!


WILLIAM: Get going, I said.


SISSI: Okay, okay, we’re out of here.


AELITA: Thanks William. Without you, I’d have been Sissi’s next victim, and that’s even worse than-


WILLIAM: Than becoming a prisoner of Xana, is that what you’re saying?


AELITA: Huh?


SISSI: William only came back ‘cause of Aelita, that’s a scoop isn’t it?


MILLY: No.


SISSI: I can’t wait to tell the news to Jeremie and see what he has to say.


TAMIYA: Now hold on.


MILLY: There’s no reason for him to know before our readers do.


TAMIYA: Once we’ve printed it, then we’ll ask Jeremie what he thinks of it.


JEREMIE: William came to Aelita’s room? You’re kidding! Are you sure he did?


SISSI: We sure are, we were there. What do you think?


JEREMIE: Well I think that… uh… I know why! She’s gonna help him catch up on um, what he missed in math.
Uh look, I’m sorry, but I gotta go now, uh, take a shower.


MILLY: Sissi, you want a scoop?


SISSI: Hm?


MILLY: A real one this time?
Okay, here, I quit.


TAMIYA: So do I, Sissi.


SISSI: But you couldn’t possibly do that!


DEFAULT: Wanna bet?


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


ULRICH: Yeah, Jeremie?


JEREMIE: Ulrich, there’s something weird going on with William.


ULRICH: {\i1} Why, what’s wrong?


JEREMIE: He left for the factory with Aelita.
I-I picked up the signals of their cell phones. I’m pretty sure this is Xana’s doing.


ULRICH: {\i1} What makes you think that?


JEREMIE: Just a hunch.


JEREMIE: {\i1} It’s strange that he escaped the digital sea. Meet you at the factory, okay?


ULRICH: Right, no problem. You get Yumi, I’ll clue Odd in.


JEREMIE: {\i1}You mean, he’s not with you?


ULRICH: Odd? No, as a matter of fact, I don’t know where he is.


JIM: Go on, keep trying. I’m sure you can do a lot better than that.


SFX: (MUSIC PLAYING)


JIM: You remember the scene don’t you, you told me that you’ve watched the film a dozen times, right?


ODD: But Jim, I swear, it’s not my fault, I didn’t tell anybody!


JIM: You’re gonna continue until you know the steps by heart.
Unless of course you’d like me to change your class instead
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)
All your pals will be so sorry not to have you with them.


SFX: (MUSIC CONTINUES)


ODD: Okay, okay, I get the picture, Jim.


YUMI: Odd was right, this film is incredibly funny.


PACO: (LAUGHING)


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


YUMI: Oh no, just when I was trying to chill out.


ULRICH: Impossible to reach Odd, I’ve already tried three times.


JEREMIE: Yeah, I’ll bet he’s living it up somewhere, just when we need him.


ULRICH: They’re not here.


JEREMIE: I can see that. They’re in Sector Five. And I don’t like that at all.
Hurry Ulrich, head for the scanner room.


ULRICH: I’m on my way.


JEREMIE: I’ll keep trying to reach Odd. We’re really gonna be needing him.


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


JIM: That’s better, much much better, just a few more hours and you’ll be all set.


JEREMIE: Oh no, where could Odd be, I wonder.


ULRICH: {\i1} I’m ready Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Okay, I’ll launch the procedure.
Transfer Ulrich.
Scanner Ulrich.
Virtualization.


JEREMIE: {\i1} Ulrich, you’ve got to take the corridor right in front of you.


ULRICH: Is there a key I’ve got to trip?


JEREMIE: {\i1} No, when we recreated Sector Five
We got rid of that procedure.


ULRICH: Okay, here I go.


JEREMIE: Better step on it, while they’re not too far away, Ulrich.
{\i1} Once you’re in the core zone, I’ll guide you.


AELITA: Where am I?
What’s going on?
William, where are you taking me?
Let me go.
Energy Field!


ULRICH: So, having fun without inviting us?
You sure have changed haven’t you?


WILLIAM: (LAUGHING)


JEREMIE: Be careful Ulrich, Xana sent some creepers, just behind you.


WILLIAM: Super smoke!


ULRICH: And I thought this was gonna be easy.


JEREMIE: Aelita, can you hear me?


AELITA: Jeremie, what’s going on?


JEREMIE: Be very careful, Aelita, William’s coming after you!


AELITA: What’s the matter with him?


JEREMIE: I have no idea. The tower in Sector Five hasn’t been activated,
but it seems that William is under the control of Xana.
You’d better get out of there fast, Aelita.


JEREMIE: Yumi, at last! Head for the scanner room, fast!
Ulrich and Aelita really need your help!


YUMI: And Odd?


JEREMIE: I’ve been trying to reach him, I don’t know where he is.


ODD: I can’t take any more of this, honestly, Jim.


JIM: Now that, my friend, is what you should have thought about before talking to the press.


DEFAULT: There he is, I told you I recognized the music!


JIM: Just what are you doing up at this hour, all of you?


DEFAULT: (SQUEALING)
You see, Jim, we just watched your disco film, it’s incredible too!


JIM: You mean, you liked it that much?


DEFAULT: It’s a masterpiece!
Would you give us your autograph, Jim?


JIM: Uh, yeah, why sure. I’d be happy to if that’s what you want.


ODD: Oh no!


JIM: To Lakisha, is that right?


AELITA: (GASPS)
Energy Field!


JEREMIE: No, Aelita, no!


AELITA: No, William, listen to me!
(SCREAMS)


JEREMIE: Ulrich, better make it snappy. William’s taking Aelita straight to the dome area.


ULRICH: I’m going my best Jeremie.
Obviously my best isn’t good enough.


YUMI: I guess you could use some help.


ULRICH: You guessed right, let’s go!
On three we attack.
One, two, three.
Impact!


YUMI: Let’s get out of here.


ODD: I didn’t get here too late, I hope?


JEREMIE: Odd, it’s about time.
What were you doing, huh?


ODD: I was taking a disco dancing class.


JEREMIE: Right, now get to the scanner room, you’re gonna go on a little trip.


ODD: Funky!


WILLIAM: Manta!


JEREMIE: What’s he trying to do now?


YUMI: What’s going on, Jeremie?


JEREMIE: {\i1} Looks as if William wants out of Sector Five.


YUMI: But I thought you hadn’t managed to create any other sectors?


JEREMIE: That’s what makes it so hard to understand.
At the end of Sector Five, there’s nothing, except
The digital sea.


JEREMIE: {\i1} If he jumps into it with Aelita, she’ll be devirtualized for good!
{\i1} Just like her father.


ULRICH: Don’t worry, Jeremie, we’ll do all we can to stop him.


YUMI: But for that, we’re gonna need our vehicles.


JEREMIE: Right, I’ll see that you get them in no time flat.
Better watch out, there are mines.


ULRICH: You okay, Yumi?


YUMI: No problem. Ulrich, in front of you!
Ulrich!


JEREMIE: {\i1} Move it Odd, they just went into the tunnel!


ODD: No problem, Einstein.


JEREMIE: {\i1} Yumi, you have to stop William from jumping into the digital sea.


YUMI: I know, Jeremie, I’m on it.


YUMI: (SCREAMING)


JEREMIE: Yumi, no!


AELITA: Yumi!


JEREMIE: Whew.


ODD: Bonzai!
I hate to cut in William, but Aelita has always prefered the company of a real gentleman.
Laser Arrow!
Sorry, but I hate being tailgated.


ULRICH: You think William’s gone forever?


JEREMIE: No, I think he just went back to his new master.
Xana.


AELITA: Why would William want to drag me into the digital sea, I don’t get it.


JEREMIE: Well I think it’s part of Xana’s new strategy.
And so we’ve got to be very careful.
William could come back at any time.


YUMI: And now we have to think up another excuse for his absence,
and Delmas might not buy it this time.


TAMIYA: Hello, Jeremie.


MILLY: Hi Jeremie.


JEREMIE: Hello.


ULRICH: They don’t hate you now?


JEREMIE: I guess they found someone they can hate even more.


YUMI: Yeah, kinda like us and William.


DEFAULT: Paco! Paco! Paco!
Bring it on, Jim!


ODD: It’s incredible, Jim’s become a real star.


ULRICH: Mainly thanks to you, right Odd?


DEFAULT: (CHEERING)


ODD: The guy’s great! Incredible presence! A real super star!


JIM: (LAUGHING)
