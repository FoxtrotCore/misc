91 - Bad Connection


ULRICH: Come on, Odd, knock it off and open this door right now!


JEREMIE: Stern, what do you think you're doing
walking around half naked?


ULRICH: Haha, very funny.
That's a pretty awful imitation of Delmas.


JEREMIE: It wasn't Delmas, it was Jim.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


JEREMIE: But what are you dressed like that for?


ULRICH: I've been stuck out here for fifteen minutes,
Odd refuses to open up.


AELITA: And how come?


ULRICH: Who knows, he won't even answer me.


JEREMIE: Let me handle it.


Odd, if you don't open up this door right now,
you can forget about my portion of meatballs.


ULRICH: Nice try, but it's not gonna work.


SFX: (DOOR UNLOCKS)


JEREMIE: Hm, never fails.


ULRICH: Hm.


JEREMIE: After you, sir.


What's wrong with you, Odd? Is it because of your film?


ODD: Yes, I mean no.


It's not the first time that a film of mine
will be screened for an audience of ignoramuses.


AELITA: Well then what's wrong?


ODD: My parents are in town, and they're coming to see my film.


YUMI: That's really nice of them.


ODD: No, it stinks.


JEREMIE: Hm?


ULRICH: (CLEARS THROAT) You didn't have a fight with them?


ODD: No, just the opposite.


ULRICH: What is it then?


ODD: A weird relationship problem.


Teenagers are always having
lots of conflicts with their parents.


A generation gap. Except for one, me.


My mother and father are always cool, supportive,
understanding. In fact, they're just perfect.


ULRICH: Bummer. I'll trade yours for mine anytime.


ODD: If there was only something that we could fight over,
so I could finally be a normal adolescent.


JEREMIE: What a major drag. I really feel sorry for you, Odd.


YUMI: We can really feel your pain.


AELITA: That's right, I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.


ODD: (SIGHS) I knew I couldn't expect you to understand.


ULRICH: Cheer up, with a little luck, they'll hate your film.


ODD: Yeah, that would be too good to be true.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: How's it going, kid?


ODD: Couldn't be better.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: (LAUGHING)


Odd, it's really so good to see you.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: And you look wonderful,
you've still got that great appetite, don't you?


ODD: (SIGHS)


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: And these must be your friends. Odd talks a lot about you.


AELITA: How do you do?


JEREMIE: Hello, sir.


YUMI: Hello.


ULRICH: Uh, hello.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: We're really delighted to mean you all at last.


Here, this is a present for you, you can wear it
to the screening, son. Why don't you try it on?


ODD: Okay, but later, I'm really much too busy right now.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: Hm?


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: Hm?


Guess he's a little uptight because of the screening.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: That's understandable, after all it is a premiere.


MR. DELMAS: You're absolutely right, of course, Odd is undeniably
talented, he's very creative, intelligent,


he participates orally in class, but-


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: It's true, he is intelligent,


you know, when he was barely two years old he managed to
completely take apart his uncle's stereo.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: And I'm sure that if he'd been four at the time,
he would have been able to put it back together again.


MR. DELMAS: Is that so? Why I happen to be quite an electronics buff
myself, and (TRAILS OFF)


(CLEARS THROAT) Anyway, as I was saying,
your son has many fine qualities, but-


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: Oh you needn't tell us that,
he's got qualities coming out of his ears.


He eats well, he has a wonderful sense of humor,
he loves a good joke.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: Even when it's not funny.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: He's a daredevil on a skateboard,
and he has an excellent ear for music, too.


MR. DELMAS: Yes, undoubtably, no doubt about it, no, however-


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: If he wanted to, Odd could be at the head of his class.


But he's just too modest for that.


MR. DELMAS: (SIGHS)


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: You were saying, Mr. Delmas?


MR. DELMAS: No, nothing.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: Oh, you've been very reassuring.


You know better than I do that young people today
just don't work hard enough at school.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: That's true, they have trouble concentrating.


MR. DELMAS: Hm.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: Well, we don't want to keep you any longer,
Mr. Delmas, you must have a lot of work to do.


MR. DELMAS: Yes.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: Good bye.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: Bye now.


MR. DELMAS: (SIGHS)


(RELIEVED SIGH)


(LAUGHS)


SISSI: Oh, what's the matter with this piece of junk?


MR. DELMAS: Something wrong, Elizabeth?


SISSI: Yes, it stopped working.


MR. DELMAS: It did? I paid a lot of money for that.


SISSI: I told you to buy the higher priced model. Hmph.


MR. DELMAS: Hm, now, now, Elizabeth, let me have a look at it.
I'll fix it for you in no time at all.


SISSI: Hm, you know how to do that?


MR. DELMAS: Why of course I do.
I have a true gift for delicate work like this.


When I was your age, my nickname was
"Mr. Circuit Breaker"- "Fixer" that is.


SFX: (PHONE CRUNCHES)


SISSI: (MOANS)


MR. DELMAS: Is this thing still under warranty?


SFX: (FOOTSTEPS)


MR. DELMAS: Sissi, hold on!


DEFAULT: (MURMURING)


JIM: Good evening. There are some empty seats in the first row.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: Uh, we'll have a large popcorn, please.


JIM: Oh, sorry, I don't have any.


But I might just have half a box of Nibble-Jacks
lying around somewhere in my room.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: I was only kidding.


JIM: Well yeah, uh, sure. So was I.


JEREMIE: I'm putting it to sleep.


Odd would kill me if the super scan went off
in the middle of his film.


AELITA: At any rate, there's not much chance that Xana would launch
an attack during the three minutes the film lasts. (LAUGHS)


SISSI: (SIGHS)


HERB: Hey, Sissi, what's the matter, you don't look so great.


SISSI: Odd has made fun of me in every single one of his films.


NICHOLAS: Yeah! (LAUGHS)


SISSI: Keep laughing, Nicholas, and the whole school
is gonna find out what happened to Mrs. Hertz' hamsters.


NICHOLAS: Okay, I'll stop.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: But where's Odd?


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: I have no idea.


ULRICH: I better go see if I can find him.


JEREMIE: Hm.


MR. CHARDIN: Very well, now we can begin.


(CLEARS THROAT) Welcome cinema lovers
to the special screening of "Mandibles and Purple Mauve",


the latest creation of our own Odd Della Robbia.


Please do forgive me for not having seen this work yet,


I understand however that film cleverly
combines fiction with documentary.


Truth, in short. But in the end, what is truth?


ULRICH: Where could he have gone?


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


ULRICH: Hm? What are you doing there?


ODD: Shh. Quiet or you'll give me away.


ULRICH: This is ridiculous, your parents are looking for you.


ODD: I know, I'm already stressed out enough.


ULRICH: Oh yeah? I've got the answer to your problem.


You're gonna get off your butt and get to a seat inside,
you got that?!


ODD: You think so?


ULRICH: Mh hm.


MR. CHARDIN: (CLEARS THROAT) Right.


But why don't we all listen now to the filmmaker himself
about his latest work? Odd, you have the floor.


ODD: Uh, hello, first of all, I would like to-


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


ODD: Hm?


MR. DELMAS: We'll start the screening as soon as
the director's father returns.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: Hello? Is this some sort of joke?


(GASPS)


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: Who was it, darling?


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: Why don't you keep quiet
and stop batting your eyes at that old goat?


MR. DELMAS: What? Let's not fly off the handle here.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: You're the fly that needs handling. I'm on to your game.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: But have you lost your mind, darling?


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: I'd prefer losing my mind to having yours.


Here, it's for you.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: (GASPS)


SFX: (PHONE RINGING)


MR. DELMAS: Yes, hello, what is it now?


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: (GRUNTS)


SFX: (PHONES RINGING ACROSS THE ROOM)


ODD: Hm?


JIM: Since when do you keep your, uh,
cell phones on in a movie theater, huh?


Huh, hey, take the wax out of your ears and listen.


SFX: (JIM'S PHONE RINGING)


JIM: (LAUGHS) Mommy, is that you? (GASPS)


ODD: If it's okay with everyone, we can begin.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: What does that little brat want?


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: Maybe he wants us to shut his trap for him.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: Wouldn't do him any harm.


ODD: Hm?


JEREMIE: Something is going on and I don't like the looks of it.


Just what I was afraid of. An activated tower.


Looks like Xana is using cell phones. If you get a call,
whatever you do, don't answer.


YUMI: Mh hm.


ODD: Hm?


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: Look at that coward, slinking away like a little rat!


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: Are we going to let that
ungrateful snot-nose take off like that?


DEFAULT: No!


JIM: Hey, it's not very polite to sneak off
like a thief in the night, you know.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: He needs to learn a little respect
whether he likes it or not.


DEFAULT: Yeah!


ODD: There's not need to get all worked up,
I'll give each of you an autograph.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: He deserves to be taught a lesson, doesn't he?


DEFAULT: Yeah!


JIM: I vote for voting against him.


SFX: (FOOTSTEPS)


JIM: Oh, man.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: Don't just stand there like a bunch of houseplants,
go on, hurry, after him!


MRS. HERTZ: Well, are we looking for a little spanking?


MILLY: There he is!


TAMIYA: And this time he's not gonna get away!


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: Keep up the pace! We're gonna get him this time.


ODD: What's wrong with everyone, is it something they ate?


SFX: (CROWD SCREECHING)


ROSA: Odd, my boy, how would you like a loving spoonful?


ODD: Thanks, Rosa, but I'm not very hungry.


JEREMIE: What's he doing? Where is he?


ULRICH: I thought he was behind us.
He must have been held up by his fan-club.


JEREMIE: I'll check out what's happening
by scanning the location of their cell phones.


Okay, I found him.


YUMI: Where is he?


JEREMIE: Take a guess.


ODD: (PANTING)


(SNIFFS)


(CHEWING)


Hm, meatballs.


Come to think of it, I am hungry. Hm.


JEREMIE: It looks pretty bad for him. He's totally surrounded.


ULRICH: We've gotta rescue him.


AELITA: But how? The whole school is out to get him.


YUMI: It'd be faster if we deactivated the tower.


JEREMIE: That's what we've gotta do.
Go on, head for the scanner room.


You're going in right now.
Let's hope that Odd can play for time.


ODD: Mm mm... The gravy! There isn't isn't gravy!


JEREMIE: Scanner Aelita.


{\i1}Scanner Yumi.


{\i1}Scanner Ulrich.


Virtualization.


{\i1}The tower in front of you, at the end of the path.


ULRICH: (SIGHS) Any suggestions, Einstein? Like a ladder, maybe?


Without vehicles, forget about it.


You could have virtualized us at the summit.


JEREMIE: Sorry, but there's a bug. I couldn't do any better.


SFX: (COMPUTER BEEPING)


JEREMIE: And now I can't even bring up your vehicles.


Xana threw a virus into the program.


{\i1}All I can get you is the Overwing.


ULRICH: Send it anyway, it'll have to do.


JEREMIE: {\i1}Coming up.


YUMI: Wanna keep me company?


ULRICH: (LAUGHS)


AELITA: Okay, let's go.


ULRICH: (SCREAMING)


YUMI: Ulrich!


(SCREAMING)


Just in time, thanks, Ulrich.


AELITA: Energy field!


HERB: He's gotta be in here somewhere.


NICHOLAS: Don't worry, watch, I'm gonna sweep him away.


HERB: Yeah, he'll be biting the dust when we get through with him.


Hey, Nicholas.


NICHOLAS: Thought you could hide from us?


Huh?


ODD: Lunch time!


NICHOLAS: You can't touch me, I am invulnerable thanks to my shield.
Go on, keep on trying.


(GRUNTS)


ODD: That is really awful wasting perfectly good food
on a vegetable like him.


HERB: Aha, alone at last.


SISSI: (NERVOUSLY LAUGHS)


ODD: Incredible, huh?


SISSI: What is happening?
It looks like everyone at school has gone crazy.


ODD: It's because of the cell phones.
How come you haven't gone bananas too?


SISSI: 'Cause my phones a broken down piece of junk.


JIM: The one place we haven't checked from top to bottom
is the lunch room!


SISSI: Let's split!


MRS. HERTZ: There he is!


DEFAULT: (SCREECHING)


MR. DELMAS: But what is my daughter doing with that little scoundrel?


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: He must have forced her to be on his side.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: Children become monsters
when they're not instilled with a sense of discipline.


YUMI: Jeremie, what are you waiting for, reprogram the Overwing.


JEREMIE: It's not working. I'll try the Overboard.


(SIGHS) I've got a problem.


YUMI: You're not the only one, hurry up!


Nice one, Aelita.


ULRICH: I can't hold on any longer!


DEFAULT: (SCREAMING)


AELITA: Yes!


ODD: Phew. Well here at least we might have a little peace.


MR. RILEY: Peace, huh? Eternal peace is what you'll get.


SISSI: (MOANS)


ODD: (SCREAMING)


AELITA: You okay?


YUMI: Yeah, thanks, Aelita.


ULRICH: Just great.


Jeremie, what's happening with Odd's board?


JEREMIE: {\i1}It's loading, but it'll take a little time.


YUMI: We could try to climb up.


ULRICH: The rock face is much too smooth, we'd never make it.


YUMI: Still scared of heights, huh?


DEFAULT: (SCREECHING)


SISSI: Oh!


ODD: You just can't get good gardener's nowadays.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: I do not think it is a very good idea to frighten
these poor children with your gardening tool, sir.


MR. RILYE: Well that's a pity.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: Rest assured, we're not the type of parents
who would ever shirk their responsibilities.


We promised you a fitting punishment,
and you're going to get it!


ODD: I promise never to complain
about not having conflicts with my parents again.


ULRICH: Looks like shellfish are back in season.


YUMI: Yeah, welcoming us with open claws.


AELITA: Okay, I'm on it.


YUMI: I'm gonna try something.


ULRICH: Yumi!


JEREMIE: Yumi, you just lost forty life points, you hear me?


YUMI: Yeah, and I can feel it too.
I'll try my best not to take another hit.


(GASPS)


Oh, what an idiot I am!


AELITA: Energy field!


I don't believe this.


ULRICH: Jeremie, we're not getting anywhere here.


JEREMIE: {\i1}I'm almost there.


Yeah, Ulrich, Overboard in two or three seconds.


ULRICH: Huh, it's about time.


Here I go.


Whoa, how does Odd manage to pilot this thing?


AELITA: He's not afraid of falling.


ODD: I'm afraid!


Oh no, anything but this.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: Trust us kid, it's for your own good.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: Just a little step forward and you won't be afraid anymore.


JIM: Obey for once in your life.


ODD: Don't we get a last request?


MR. DELMAS: It's true, they do have the right to that.


ODD: I'd like one last club sandwich with organic mayo.


SISSI: Huh?


ROSA: Okay, one club sandwich, but forget the organic mayo.


SISSI: And I would like purple parachute to go with my top.


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: Hm, okay, okay, timeout,
last requests are gonna have to wait until later.


SISSI: (MOANING)


ULRICH: Aelita!


JEREMIE: {\i1}Hurry up, Aelita! The coast is clear!


SFX: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: I think these children could use a little parental guidance.


MR. DELMAS: Absolutely.


SISSI: (MOANS)


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: Alright, let's get this over with.


SISSI: (MOANS)


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: (SIGHS)


MR. DELLA ROBBIA: But what are we doing up where?


AELITA: Tower deactivated.


SISSI: (GASPS)


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: Odd, you know better than to get so close to the edge,
don't you?


ODD: Oh yeah? I wonder who could have pushed me to the edge.


MRS. DELLA ROBBIA: Hm?


JEREMIE: Uh, return to the past, now!


ODD: And here, we have a splendid specimen of a dung beetle.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


JIM: Huh? (LAUGHS)


ODD: And now, we have a magnificent field grasshopper.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


SISSI: Oh, he's saving the worst for last.


ODD: But what could this strange creature be? A spring roll?


No, no, it's an enormous larva.


DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)


ODD: A caterpillar, metamorphosizing into a lovely butterfly.


DEFAULT: Awh...


SISSI: Hm?


ODD: Hm.


SISSI: (NERVOUSLY LAUGHS)
