SISSI: Why don’t you just\Ngo back to your dolls
SISSI: and stop dreaming?
MILLY: Oh, yeah?

JEREMIE: Hi, Yumi, come in.
YUMI: What are you doing?
JEREMIE: I’m working on a new program.
JEREMIE: A sort of catastrophe\Nalarm system.
JEREMIE: The idea is to rate\Nnon-natural disasters
JEREMIE: on a scale of one to ten.
JEREMIE: And once I’ve got it finished,
JEREMIE: I’m gonna get it\Nonto every website,
JEREMIE: or information network\Nif you like,
JEREMIE: and any time the system\Nregisters a disaster
JEREMIE: that rates higher than five,\Nit automatically informs me.
YUMI: And then what?
JEREMIE: It’s the surest way\Nfor me to identify
JEREMIE: a possible XANA attack.
YUMI: Wow. That’s cool.
JEREMIE: What’s on your mind?
YUMI: Well, it…it’s Ulrich.
YUMI: I wonder…do you think\Nhe likes Sissi?
JEREMIE: Sissi? You’re kidding.\NCome on!
JEREMIE: You know, I never\Nwould’ve believed it,
JEREMIE: but you’re really jealous,\Naren’t you?
YUMI: What? You’re kidding!
YUMI: How could you think\Nfor a minute
YUMI: that I could be\Njealous of that dimwit!
YUMI: That is ridiculous!

ODD: There’s nothing in the world\NI would rather do.
ODD: What’s your idea, huh?
SFX: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
SISSI: A message!
SISSI: “You’re the fairest of them all.\NI can’t resist you.
SISSI: Meet me in the garden shed.”
SISSI: Ah, I knew it!

FEMALE SPEAKER #1: How long before they collide?
MALE SPEAKER #1: 26 minutes.
MALE SPEAKER #1: But the 3611 is\Na special convoy train
MALE SPEAKER #1: carrying a load of\Nhighly toxic chemicals.
JEREMIE: One last adjustment,
JEREMIE: and the program should\Nbe ready.
JEREMIE: There we go.
JEREMIE: Now there’s nothing left to do
JEREMIE: but wait until\NXANA rears his evil head.
NEWS ANCHOR #1: A mysterious\Nand powerful virus
NEWS ANCHOR #1: infected all of the country’s\Nmain computer systems
NEWS ANCHOR #1: just a few minutes ago.

MR. SWAMP: Thank you, Ellen.
MR. SWAMP: That’s right. Two freight trains\Nare on a collision course.

MR. SWAMP: which if spread\Ninto the atmosphere,
MR. SWAMP: would cause an unprecedented\Nenvironmental catastrophe.
NEWS ANCHOR #1: John, is there any way\Nof preventing this disaster?
MR. SWAMP: None at all\Nfor the simple reason
MR. SWAMP: that the trains are\Nboth computer-operated
MR. SWAMP: and therefore impossible\Nto control at this time.
MR. SWAMP: It’ll take a miracle to stop them.
MR. SWAMP: The authorities are\Nconsidering an evacuation
MR. SWAMP: of the local population.
