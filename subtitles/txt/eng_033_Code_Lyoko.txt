ULRICH: I can’t remember the equation.
ULRICH: The square root of\Na quotient equals uh…
ODD: Uh, zero?
ODD: Uh, no. Ten?
ODD: No, wait. I give up.
ODD: Hey, wait! Where are you going?
ULRICH: To study for the science final.
ULRICH: It's tomorrow and I can't exactly\Ncount on you to help me.
ODD: You must be kidding!
ODD: We'll miss the afternoon snack!
ODD: And don't get all worked up\Nabout that exam!
ODD: I've got a little something in mind.
ULRICH: This little something.
ULRICH: Does it start with cheat, and\Nend in cheat, by any chance?
ODD: Wow! You just read my mind!
ULRICH: Oh, forget about your dumb plan.
ODD: Gee thanks a lot, Ulrich,\Nfor being so supportive.
SISSI: Wow, I am really knocked out!
SISSI: Bet you can't guess why!
ODD: Don’t tell me!
ODD: The members of the band\NLove Potion split up?
SISSI: Come on. That’s old news, you dork!
SISSI: Brian fell in love with Crystal Pearl,\Nand so Geoffrey kicked them out!
SISSI: Now listen to this, huh.
SISSI: The news is…
SISSI: my father said it was\Nokay to use the gymnasium!
ODD: He said yes?
SISSI: Mmhm.
ODD: Yes!
ODD: I've gotta find William!
SISSI: Oh, it’s going to be the dance\Nparty of the century!
JIM: (BLOWS WHISTLE)
JIM: Hurry it up!
JIM: You two! Take those mats\Ninto the storage room.
JIM: (BLOWS WHISTLE)
JIM: You! Push that pommel horse\Nagainst the wall!
JIM: Come on! Move it!
WILLIAM: Oh, no!
WILLIAM: I don’t believe this!
ODD: So it’s really true, huh?
ODD: The principle gave the\Ntechno party the green light?
WILLIAM: It looks like it. Yeah.
ODD: Wow! Smoking, huh?
ODD: The best DJ’s from all the\Nlocal schools will be there.
ODD: It’s gonna be a blast!
WILLIAM: I’m not blasting anything.
WILLIAM: The mixing board is hammered!
WILLIAM: I can’t figure out how to fix it.
ODD: Hey, no problem.
ODD: We’ll ask Jeremie.
ODD: He’s Mister Fix-It.
ODD: He can fix anything.
WILLIAM: You think so?
ODD: Yeah!
JEREMIE: No!
JEREMIE: I got better things to do with my time\Nthan play around with a mixing board.
AELITA: Maybe I can help.
ODD: Would you?
JEREMIE: Uh, but what about our\Nresearch on your antivirus?
AELITA: I’m just sitting around\Nwatching you at this stage.
ODD: Great! Come on!
JEREMIE: What about the science final?
JEREMIE: Don’t you ever study?
ODD: It’s in the bag!
JEREMIE: (GROANS)
AELITA: So, then…
AELITA: This is the thing\Nthat makes the music?
ODD: Yup.
ODD: You play the records on the turntables.
ODD: The board mixes one song with another.
ODD: The trick is to synchronise the sound.
AELITA: Interesting.
WILLIAM: It doesn’t sound like you know an awful lot about it.
WILLIAM: Will it take much longer?
AELITA: No. I’m done.
WILLIAM: Mind if I give it a try?
WILLIAM: Huh. Hey, it's working!
WILLIAM: Aelita, fantastic!
WILLIAM: You want to try?
AELITA: Well, yeah.
AELITA: Why not?
WILLIAM: Wow!
WILLIAM: I’ve never managed\Nto get that kind of mix.
JIM: Hey, goof-offs!\NWell, don't mind me!
JIM: Do you know what\Ntime it is by any chance!
ODD: Uh, we’re really sorry, Jim.
ODD: We’re rehearsing for tomorrow night.
ODD: Do you like techno?
JIM: Forget about it.
JIM: (SCOFFS) Electronic music.
JIM: I prefer the twist!
WILLIAM: Aelita, you really mix like a pro.
WILLIAM: Where’d you learn?
AELITA: Uh…um…
ODD: Uh, it runs in the family!
ODD: We’re all artists. We’re creative!
WILLIAM: I’ll make a selection of LP’s,
WILLIAM: and you can be our DJ!\NTomorrow night!
WILLIAM: Okay?
AELITA: You think so?
AELITA: Well, uh, okay!
JEREMIE: You’re wasting your time with this party.
AELITA: I am not wasting my time.
AELITA: I’m trying to live. Like you guys.
AELITA: And have some fun -- a good time.
AELITA: That’s human too, isn’t it?
JEREMIE: You mean you don’t have a good time\Nresearching the antivirus with me?
AELITA: You’re as stubborn as a fool!
JEREMIE: It’s stubborn as a mule!
ULRICH: Odd, you didn’t study at all?
ODD: Nope.
ODD: But like I told Jeremie, it’s in the bag.
ODD: Huh? What’s going on?
ODD: Can’t we go in?
SISSI: Inspection by G.I. Jim.
JIM: (MILITARY DRUMLINE)
JIM: One pen! That’s all you can take in!
ODD: Ouch.
ODD: That’s an unexpected development.
ULRICH: Mhmn.
MRS. HERTZ: You have two hours for physics,\Nand then two hours for chemistry.
MRS. HERTZ: My colleagues and I will\Ncorrect the exams this afternoon.
MRS. HERTZ: After that, the principal himself\Nwill announce the results.
MRS. HERTZ: You may begin.
SISSI: (SIGHS)
JIM: The test is over!
JIM: Put your pens down\Nand stay where you are
JIM: While I collect all of your papers.
JIM: Stay in your seats\Nuntil I have all of them!
JIM: Hmm.
JIM: Well done, Odd.\NThat’s…one of your best yet.
JIM: Misses Hertz…
JIM: Hertz, ah, Hertz…
JIM: I hope she’ll let me keep\NOdd’s paper swan for my collection.
JIM: Huh?
MUSIC: (UNNERVING MUSIC)
YUMI: Well?
ODD: Sure, never felt better.
YUMI: I was talking about your exam, stupid.
ODD: It looks like I’m gonna\Nbe left back this year.
YUMI: Oh, don’t exaggerate.
YUMI: But it wouldn’t have\Nkilled you to study a little.
ULRICH: Cut it out.
ULRICH: This is not the time.
ODD: Hey, we’re gonna see Aelita the DJ!
ODD: That’s bound to cheer us up!
ODD: Where is she, by the way?
ULRICH: She’s already in the gym.
ULRICH: The DJ’s get VIP treatment.
YUMI: What about Jeremie?
ODD: He’s sulking.
MR. DELMAS: You are not going, and that is that!
SISSI: But please, daddy!
SISSI: It’s the happening of the century!
MR. DELMAS: You should have thought of that earlier\Nand studied for the exam!
MUSIC: (UNNERVING MUSIC CONTINUES)
JEREMIE: XANA!
JEREMIE: He sure picks his moments.
JEREMIE: Desert sector. Okay.
JEREMIE: Oh, no!
DEFAULT: (TECHNO MUSIC, CHEERING)
MILLY: Aelita?
MILLY: A question for the school paper!
MILLY: As a DJ, how would you define your style?
MILLY: Hardcore, deep house, or downright new beat?
AELITA: Um…
WILLIAM: She’s a little too nervous to answer.
WILLIAM: I’d say her style is more hardcore,\Nbut it’s more a style of her own.
TAMIYA: Totally rad!
SISSI: Tada!
NICHOLAS: You snuck out?
SISSI: No, no.
SISSI: My father said,\N“you’re gonna repeat the year,
: "but it’s no big deal, sweetie.
SISSI: Doesn’t mean you can’t\Nhave a good time!”
NICHOLAS: Is that what he said?
SISSI: Oh, you’re such an idiot!
SISSI: Of course I snuck out.\NWhat do you think?
DEFAULT: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
SOME GUY: And now Aelita!\NA brand new DJ!
SOME GUY: And as you’re gonna see,
SOME GUY: She totally rips!

JEREMIE: Kiwi, no!
JEREMIE: Come back!
JEREMIE: That mutt is as brainless as his owner.
SISSI: Oh…
JEREMIE: Huh?
JEREMIE: Kiwi, this is no time for games.
JEREMIE: You have to go and get\NOdd and the others
: from the gymnasium, you hear?
JEREMIE: Now go get Odd!
JEREMIE: Yeah! That's a good dog!
JEREMIE: Run!
JEREMIE: Ugh. With my luck, he’ll\Ncome back with the principal.
ODD: What’s up?
ODD: Not dancing?
WILLIAM: Nah, it’s not my thing.
ODD: Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Come on!
ODD: Let me see how you move!
ODD: Oh. You’re right.
ODD: It’s not your thing.
KIWI: (BARKS)
ODD: Nice dog sounds.
ODD: Where did Aelita sample that from?
ODD: Hey, what are you doing here, buddy?

JIM: Go on with your party.
DEFAULT: (MUSIC CONTINUES,\NINDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT)
ULRICH: Are you sure that\NJim can virtualize Aelita
ULRICH: and send her to Lyoko?
JEREMIE: Under XANA’s control,\Nhe can do anything.
YUMI: Oh, no.
YUMI: Aelita doesn’t stand a chance\Nalone against the scyphozoa.
ODD: And she can say bye-bye to her memory.
ULRICH: They’re not here.
ULRICH: Hurry. Let’s head for the factory.

JIM: (GROANS)
ODD: And he’s brought a friend\Nalong with him, too.

ULRICH: What are you suggesting?
ODD: The puppet thing!
ODD: Like the way we\Nhandled the Kankrelats.
ODD: Hey, Jim!
ODD: You didn’t think a little tap like that\Nwould knock me out, did you?
YOU'LL: Hiyah!

YUMI: Have you programmed the vehicles?
JEREMIE: Of course. I think of everything.
JEREMIE: So does XANA, I guess,\Nfrom the looks of it.
JEREMIE: You got company.
JEREMIE: Faster! If the scyphozoa
JEREMIE: gets there before you do,\NAelita's done for!
ODD: Go on ahead.
ODD: Leave the hornets to me.

ODD: Right?
JEREMIE: Promise.
AELITA: Promise.
SISSI: Wow, I am really knocked out!
SISSI: Bet you can’t guess why!
ODD: Your father said okay\Nfor the gymnasium?
SISSI: Huh?
SISSI: How did you know that?
ODD: Well, I’ve already lived through this day\Nand I just traveled back through time.
SISSI: You’re a real looney.
