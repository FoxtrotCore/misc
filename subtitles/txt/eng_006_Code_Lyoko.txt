MR. DELMAS: Dear students,\Nthis magnificent stadium
MR. DELMAS: is being built in close cooperation\Nwith the board of education.
MR. DELMAS: Soon, you will be enjoying\Nthe latest in sports equipment,
MR. DELMAS: and I personally am delighted\Nsince my duty is to provide you
MR. DELMAS: with the finest working conditions\Npossible, and in all areas.
MR. DELMAS: Both intellectual and athletic.
MR. DELMAS: Since, as Juvenal said,\N“A sound mind in a sound body.”
ODD: Wow, can he talk.
: Do we really have to\Nlisten to all this?
ULRICH: Not really.
ULRICH: You could’ve stayed\Nwith Jeremie if you wanted to.
YUMI: What’s Einstein up to, anyway?
ODD: The usual.
ODD: He’s glued to\Nhis computer screen
ODD: in a big cyber-conversation\Nwith his darling Aelita.
JEREMIE: Just a couple of\Ncalculations to go,
JEREMIE: and my devirtualization program\Nwill be completed.
AELITA: And…do you really think\Nit’s going to work, Jeremie?
AELITA: Do I have a chance of finally\Nbecoming materialized in your world,
AELITA: and becoming somebody…\Nsomebody like you?
JEREMIE: I sure hope so.
JEREMIE: Anyway, there’s one thing\Nthat I’m sure of.
JEREMIE: I’ve never been as close\Nto the answer as I am now.
AELITA: Honestly, it’s so hard to imagine.
AELITA: We can be face to face\Nin the same room.
AELITA: We can touch each other.\NEven kiss.
JEREMIE: Uh, yeah.\NThat’d be uh…interesting.
JEREMIE: I mean, well uh, I guess.
JEREMIE: Now, get ready.
JEREMIE: I’m starting the test program.
JEREMIE: I don’t get it.
AELITA: It’s not the end of the world.
AELITA: I’m sure, Jeremie,\Nthat one day you’ll succeed.
JEREMIE: Aelita, I…
JEREMIE: I’m beginning to wonder\Nif I’m up to the job.
JEREMIE: If I’m good enough for\Nsuch a complicated program.
JEREMIE: I’m sorry. I’m just\Ntired and jumpy, that’s all.
JEREMIE: I’d better go and stretch my legs.
JEREMIE: See you later.
ODD: Huh? Jeremie?
ODD: Hey, what’s this?
ODD: Another one of Jeremie’s\Nmaterialization programs.
ODD: Oh, wow! Candy!
JEREMIE: Odd!
JEREMIE: How many times\Nhave I told you
JEREMIE: not to touch my computer\Nwhen I’m not here?
JEREMIE: There are months of work in there!
ODD: Relax, Max!
ODD: I didn’t hurt your little toy.
JEREMIE: Oh, no.\NYou’re such a cosmic creep.
JEREMIE: Now look what you’ve done.
JEREMIE: Those keys are incredibly sensitive.
ODD: Okay, okay.
ODD: A little piece of candy’s\Nnot gonna wreck your keyboard!
JEREMIE: Huh?
JEREMIE: That’s crazy!
JEREMIE: This is really mega insane!
JEREMIE: Yes, it works!
JEREMIE: Odd, you’re a genius,\Nyou know that!
ODD: Hey, make up your mind!
ODD: Am I a genius or a creep?
JEREMIE: You’re a creepy genius.
JEREMIE: You didn’t do it on purpose,
JEREMIE: but by dropping the candies\Non the keyboard,
JEREMIE: you modified and\Nrelaunched my program!
JEREMIE: I don’t know exactly\Nwhat happened, but it works!
JEREMIE: Thanks, Odd!
ODD: Who’s an Einstein now?
ODD: Are you gonna materialize Aelita?
JEREMIE: Well, yeah.
JEREMIE: The problem is I only get\None try and that’s it.
JEREMIE: That’s because I didn’t see
JEREMIE: what kind of programming\Nthe candy typed in.
ODD: Yeah, so?
ODD: There’s only one Aelita.
JEREMIE: Go and tell the others.
JEREMIE: I’ll announce\Nthe good news to Aelita.
JEREMIE: Yumi, it’s now or never.
JEREMIE: We may not get a second chance.
JEREMIE: What if there’s some kind of bug?
JEREMIE: I’ll never be able to\Nset up the program again!
YUMI: Listen, you can’t just\Nmaterialize Aelita like that
YUMI: without making a lot of preparations.
JEREMIE: I’ve boosted the scans.\NI’ve got the program going.
JEREMIE: Everything’s ready.
ULRICH: Yeah, in your head.
ULRICH: Hey, come back to earth, Jeremie.
ULRICH: Try to be practical for once.
ULRICH: Aelita has no parents,
ULRICH: and she hasn’t got\Na birth certificate.
ULRICH: What’s more, she’s not\Nenrolled in any school.
ULRICH: Okay, that’s no biggie,
ULRICH: but all that together means\Nshe doesn’t exist in our world.
ODD: Imagine,\N“Hello, I’m Aelita,
ODD: “I just got here\Nfrom a virtual reality!”
ODD: That’s a one-way ticket\Nto the nuthouse.
AELITA: You know, Jeremie,\Nit doesn’t have to be today.
AELITA: I can wait.
JEREMIE: Well, what do we do now?
YUMI: I can put her up at my house.\NMy folks wouldn’t mind.
ULRICH: And you could plug into\Nthe city hall computers,
ULRICH: and create a phony\Nidentity for her.
ULRICH: Find her a new name.\NAll the stuff she needs.
ODD: Then you just have to\Nenroll her at our school.
ODD: And try to put her in our class!\NThat’d be really cool, huh?
JEREMIE: Okay.
JEREMIE: We’ll get started\Nfirst thing tomorrow.
JEREMIE: Aelita, are you asleep?
AELITA: Am I asleep?
AELITA: Come on, Jeremie, you know that\Nvirtual beings never sleep.
JEREMIE: I can’t sleep a wink.
JEREMIE: I can’t stop thinking\Nabout your materialization,
JEREMIE: and it's keeping me up.
JEREMIE: You can’t imagine all the things\Nyou’re gonna discover in our world.
AELITA: You mean like sleeping?
JEREMIE: That’s right.
JEREMIE: That and all kinds of fun things.
AELITA: Tell me more.
JIM: (SNORING)
MUSIC: (SINISTER MUSIC)
JEREMIE: When you touch an object\Nwith your fingers,
JEREMIE: you have a sort of sensation.
JEREMIE: It could be a feeling\Nof softness or of heat.
JEREMIE: It could be cold.
AELITA: Oh, I see.
AELITA: I thought you only sensed\Nwith your brain.
JEREMIE: That’s right.
JEREMIE: But it’s a little more complicated.
JEREMIE: Here on earth,\Neveryone has five senses.
JEREMIE: You, Aelita,\Nyou only have two of them.
JEREMIE: Hearing and seeing.
JEREMIE: You can only see and hear.
AELITA: Speaking of hearing…
JEREMIE: Soon you’re gonna be\Nable to touch, and to…
AELITA: Jeremie, I think I just heard XANA.
AELITA: He’s up to something.
JEREMIE: What’s all the noise about, I wonder.
AELITA: Jeremie, XANA’s launched an attack.
JEREMIE: Okay. Listen, Aelita.
JEREMIE: Go and hide in a deactivated tower.
JEREMIE: I’ll contact you from the factory.
JEREMIE: Odd, wake up!\NXANA’s attacking!
JEREMIE: Odd, wake up!
ODD: What was that?
ODD: W-What did you say\Nabout carpet tacking?
JEREMIE: Ulrich, get up!
JEREMIE: It’s a XANA alert!
ULRICH: What did you say?
JEREMIE: I said it’s a XANA alert!\NXANA’s attacking!
ODD: Hey, do you always sleep\Nwith those things in your ears?
ULRICH: Yeah, Odd. Always.
ULRICH: And one of these days,\NI’ll tell you why.
ODD: No need to look any further, guys.
ODD: This time he picked a real winner.
ODD: He’s attacking us with bulldozers!
ODD: Nice going, XANA.\NHow subtle can you get?
ULRICH: Jeremie, rush over\Nto the lab and call Yumi.
ULRICH: Odd and I are gonna\Ntry and stop these monsters.
ULRICH: I’ll take the front one.
ODD: Got you.
ODD: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
JEREMIE: Come on, Yumi, get up!\NWe really need you!
YUMI: Do you realize what time it is?
YUMI: Bulldozers? What bulldozers?
YUMI: What!?
ODD: Hey, XANA’s controlling the thing!
ODD: I don’t know what to do, Ulrich!
ULRICH: That makes two of us.
ULRICH: You go and meet\NYumi and Jeremie at the lab.
ULRICH: If I can find out what XANA\Nwants to do with these monsters,
ULRICH: that sure would help.
ODD: Okay. Just be careful.
JEREMIE: Keep your eyes open, Aelita.
JEREMIE: You never know where\NXANA’s monsters are hiding.
AELITA: Don’t worry, Jeremie.
AELITA: No enemy in sight for the moment.
AELITA: But the pulse beats\Nare getting stronger.
AELITA: The activated tower\Ncan’t be too far away.
JEREMIE: Aelita, don’t worry.
JEREMIE: Odd should be there soon.
JEREMIE: And now let’s hope that\NYumi and Ulrich are on their way.
ODD: Ulrich?
ODD: He’s on the bulldozer\Ntrying to find out what XANA’s up to.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, do you read me?
ULRICH: Bad news, Jeremie.
ULRICH: I’m on the river bank.
ULRICH: And I’m afraid XANA’s\Ntargeted the factory.
JEREMIE: That’s got to be it.
JEREMIE: If XANA manages\Nto destroy our factory,
JEREMIE: we can say goodbye\Nto our equipment.
JEREMIE: No more computer meaning\Nno more communication with Aelita.
ODD: Don’t forget about the scans.
ODD: Without them,\Nno more transfers to Lyoko.
ODD: And that means\Ntotal victory for XANA.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, listen.
JEREMIE: Odd’s just about to go it alone,
JEREMIE: so if you don’t mind, hurry up.
ULRICH: I’ll do my best,
ULRICH: but I can’t promise you\Na graceful entrance.
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE: Scanner.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
AELITA: Oh, hello, Odd.
AELITA: You’re looking stressed.
ODD: No, I’m okay, Aelita.
ODD: It’s just that I never know\Nwhat I’m gonna find
ODD: whenever I come here.
AELITA: Come with me, Odd.
AELITA: The activated tower is this way.
ODD: Okay. Let’s go and check it out.
ULRICH: Oh, no!
JEREMIE: Ulrich, do you read me?
YUMI: Jeremie?
JEREMIE: Yumi, I’ve lost contact with Ulrich.
YUMI: Where was he\Nwhen you last spoke to him?
JEREMIE: He was heading\Nfor the factory with the bulldozers.
YUMI: Right. I’m almost there.
YUMI: I’ll find him.
AELITA: That way.
ODD: Talk about a reception committee.
AELITA: Usually roachsters\Nmove in groups of five.
ODD: Wow, and it looks like\Nthe committee's a full strength.
ODD: Hello, roachsters.
ODD: Now, which one of you\Nwants to be first?
JEREMIE: Hey, would you cool it,\Nhuh, Odd?
JEREMIE: Your mission is to\Nprotect Aelita, remember?
ODD: You want to trade places, Jeremie?
YUMI: Ulrich!
YUMI: Ulrich, get up! Ulrich, hurry up!
JEREMIE: Odd, you’ve used up\Nfour of your ten arrows.
ODD: Here comes three more.
ODD: Laser arrow!
YUMI: Ulrich, you’ve got to get up!
YUMI: Ulrich!
YUMI: Hey, Jeremie,
YUMI: can you give me a hand?
JEREMIE: What about the bulldozers?
YUMI: It’s a mess up there.
JEREMIE: I wish it were only up there.
YUMI: How’s Odd doing?
ODD: Jeremie, I’m starting to get\Na little lonely out here!
JEREMIE: That answer your question?
YUMI: Gotcha.
JEREMIE: Okay, Odd.
JEREMIE: Yumi’s on her way.
JEREMIE: As for Ulrich, let’s just say\Nhe’s fast asleep.
ODD: He is? Well, that must be tough.
ODD: I mean, without his ear plugs.
JEREMIE: Transfer Yumi.
JEREMIE: Scanner.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
JEREMIE: Odd, figure out a way\Nto slow down the roachsters.
JEREMIE: You’re way ahead of Yumi.
ODD: Take care of the tower.
ODD: I’ll take care of the roachsters.
ODD: Let’s see what the score is.
ODD: Three roachsters\Nand three laser arrows left.
ODD: Odd, this is no time\Nto miss your target.
ODD: Jeremie, how many\Nlife points have I got left?
JEREMIE: Ten. Hang on.\NYumi’s almost there.
ODD: (WHISTLES)
ODD: That’s it for you.
ODD: Where’s your buddy hiding?
ODD: Yumi--
ODD: uh-oh.
YUMI: No!
YUMI: Hey, Jeremie,\NI didn’t make it in time.
YUMI: It’s game over for Odd.
YUMI: I’ll back up Aelita\Nin case she needs help.
JEREMIE: I don’t want to\Nstress you out or anything,
JEREMIE: but if the scans are destroyed,\Nyou’re on a one-way trip, Yumi.
YUMI: No problem. I’ll hurry.
YUMI: I wouldn’t mind\Na little nap before class.
ODD: Jeremie, it isn’t the scanner\Nshe has to worry about.
ODD: I just had a vision.
ODD: I saw Yumi falling\Ninto the digital void.
JEREMIE: Virtualized forever?
JEREMIE: Hey, Yumi.
YUMI: I head him.
ULRICH: I’ll go and help her.
ODD: What?
JEREMIE: Come on, Ulrich,\Ntake a look at yourself.
JEREMIE: The shape you’re in, it’d be crazy.
ULRICH: Odd, help me.
AELITA: Jeremie.
JEREMIE: I saw it.
JEREMIE: Yumi’s on her way to help you.
JEREMIE: Give me a visual.
ODD: There it is!
ODD: That’s exactly\Nwhere I saw Yumi fall!
JEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Scanner.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
YUMI: Jeremie, I can’t hold on anymore.
JEREMIE: Aelita’s inside the tower now.
JEREMIE: Hang on, Yumi.
YUMI: I can’t…
ULRICH: Yumi, I coming!
ULRICH: Yumi!
ULRICH: No!
JEREMIE: (INAUDIBLE)
JEREMIE: I never would’ve\Nthought it was possible
JEREMIE: for one of us to become…
ULRICH: It’s all my fault.
ULRICH: If I had been faster,\Nshe would still be here.
AELITA: But there is a solution.\NAnd Jeremie knows what it is.
JEREMIE: The materialization program.
JEREMIE: It’s operational, but Aelita has to\Ngive up her place to Yumi.
ULRICH: Can you bring Yumi back here?
JEREMIE: Yes, but I can only\Nmaterialize one person.
JEREMIE: One and only one.
AELITA: Then choose Yumi.
AELITA: She’s part of your world already.
AELITA: It’s okay.\NI can wait a little longer.
JEREMIE: Okay, Aelita.
JEREMIE: But first of all, I need to\Ntrack down Yumi in the digital void.
ULRICH: It’s alright, Yumi,\Nyou’re gonna be okay.
ODD: Welcome home!
YUMI: But…
: how did you\Nget me back here?
JEREMIE: I’m happy,\Nand at the same time, I’m sad.
AELITA: Why?
AELITA: At least you know\Nthe program works!
AELITA: You just have to\Nset it back up again.
JEREMIE: Yeah, nothing to it.
AELITA: I have faith in you, Jeremie.
AELITA: One day, you’ll get me there.\NI’m sure.
ODD: Hey, Jeremie,\Nwant some candy?
JEREMIE: Hey, what are you\Ndoing with that? It’s mine!
ODD: Oh, yeah, I guess it is.
ODD: Okay, no problemo.\NHere you go.
YUMI: Come on, have one.
YUMI: Candy can fix anything.
YUMI: Even a broken heart.
JEREMIE: If you say so.
