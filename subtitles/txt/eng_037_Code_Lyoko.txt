ULRICH: Peter Duncan escaped\Nfrom a police transport van
ULRICH: without any outside help?
YUMI: Yeah, that’s what they\Nsaid on the radio.
ODD: You know, ever since David Copperfield
ODD: made the statue of liberty disappear,
ODD: nothing surprises me anymore.
YUMI: What bothers me is that
YUMI: the two police officers\Nwho were guarding him
YUMI: talked about a supernatural force.
ULRICH: You think XANA is involved?
JEREMIE: Not a chance.
JEREMIE: The super scanner doesn’t\Nshow any activated tower.
JEREMIE: I just checked.
YUMI: I hope you’re right.
YUMI: Imagine public enemy number one\Nunder XANA’s control.
YUMI: Talk about double trouble.
ODD: A public enemy?
ODD: What did this Duncan guy do?
JEREMIE: Oh, nothing much.
JEREMIE: Fine art theft, safe cracking,\Nkidnapping, bank robberies.
YUMI: You okay, Aelita?
AELITA: Yes, uh…
AELITA: I just didn’t sleep\Nvery well last night.
JEREMIE: Don’t forget we have a math test.
JEREMIE: You gonna be alright?
AELITA: No problem.
DEFAULT: (SINISTER MUSIC)
MRS. MEYER: As you all know, the exam\Ncovers the principles of division.
MRS. MEYER: I hope you’ve studied hard.
ODD: Hey, Ulrich, what’s the last digit
ODD: of a number divisible by two, huh?
MRS. MEYER: Zero.
ODD: Oh, yeah! That’s the answer.
ODD: Well done, mam!
MRS. MEYER: No, that’s the grade\Nyou’re going to get
MRS. MEYER: if you keep trying to cheat.
ODD: Oh.
MRS. MEYER: Well, Jeremie, is there a problem?
JEREMIE: I finished, mam.
MRS. MEYER: I see. Good work!

DOCTOR 1: Okay, what have we got?
DOCTOR 2: Adolescent. 12 years old, unconscious.
DOCTOR 2: Very weak pulse, irregular heartbeat.
DOCTOR 1: Put her in bay one.
DOCTOR 1: She’s gone into fibrillation.
DOCTOR 3: 10 mils of adrexin.

DOCTOR 3: That kid’s got a real\Nguardian angel, that’s for sure.
JEREMIE: So, how is she?
DOCTOR 1: She’s fine. Don’t worry.
DOCTOR 1: She’ll be alright, but it’s\Nan extraordinary case.
YUMI: Can we see her?
DOCTOR 1: I don’t see why not,\Nbut not too much noise.
DOCTOR 1: She needs to rest.
ODD: Don’t worry, doctor!
ODD: Everyone knows I’m quiet and calm.
YUMI: How were your test results?
AELITA: Completely normal.
ULRICH: Maybe it’s got something\Nto do with the fact
ULRICH: that you’re not really human.
AELITA: It could be the virus that\NXANA implanted in me.
YUMI: Did you find anything, Jeremie?
JEREMIE: Dead calm as far XANA’s concerned.
JEREMIE: No activated towers.
JEREMIE: Although the superscan\Nseems to have reset itself.
JEREMIE: It’s not giving the right results.
ODD: Kind of like me.
ODD: I guess it didn’t study, either.
JEREMIE: No class this afternoon.
JEREMIE: I’m going to pay a visit to\Nthe factory to check it out.
ULRICH: We’ll go with you.
YUMI: I’ll stay here.
YUMI: We can have a\Ngirl-to-girl talk for once.

DRIVER: Hands up!
JEREMIE: That’s exactly what I was afraid of.
ULRICH: What?
JEREMIE: The superscan bugged up.
JEREMIE: I’ll find out why in a minute.
ODD: The real question is --\Ncan you fix it?
JEREMIE: Well, normally, yeah.
JEREMIE: But the debugging phase takes time.
JEREMIE: I don’t know if it’s a minor bug\Nor something more serious--
ODD: Okay, okay.
ODD: If XANA’s activated a tower,\Nwe’ll find it much faster
ODD: by going directly to Lyoko.
ODD: You coming, Ulrich?
ULRICH: Mmhmm.
JEREMIE OFF: Transfer Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE OFF: Scanner Ulrich.
JEREMIE OFF: Scanner Odd.
JEREMIE: Virtualization!
ULRICH: All clear here.
ULRICH: We’re gonna have to\Nsearch all the sectors.
JEREMIE: Don’t panic.
JEREMIE: I’m calling up your\Nvehicles, guys.
ODD OFF: Jeremie, how’s it going\Nwith the superscan?
JEREMIE: Not too great.
ODD: Well, anyway, you\Nmight as well forget it.
ODD: No, wait! We found it!
ULRICH: Activated tower dead ahead.
JEREMIE: Right I’ve got it.
JEREMIE OFF: 25 degrees north northeast.
JEREMIE: Nice job, you guys!
ULRICH: Now all we got to do is\Nbring Aelita here to deactivate it.
JEREMIE: Okay, I’m bringing you in.
JEREMIE: That’s great. Now what’s up.
JEREMIE: Oh, no!
JEREMIE: Can you hear me? Hey!

ULRICH: Jeremie?
ODD: Must’ve forgotten\Nto pay his phone bill.
YUMI: The funniest part is --
YUMI: Hiroki says to my father,
YUMI: papa, when I grow up,\NI’m gonna look like you,
YUMI: but with muscles!
AELITA: (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)
YUMI: Aelita?
DEFAULT: (FLATLINES)
YUMI: Oh, no.\NI don’t believe it.
YUMI: Get a doctor! Quickly!
JEREMIE: What’s wrong with\Nthis darn supercomputer.
ODD: Uh, Jeremie, are you\Ngonna bring us in or not?
ULRICH: We’ll have to\Nmanage without him.
ULRICH: Get ready.
ODD: One.
ODD: Two.
ODD: Three!
ODD: Ugh!
ULRICH: Aah!
ODD: W-We can’t be devirtualized.
ULRICH: The scanners must be offline.
ULRICH: What is going on\Naround here, anyway?
ODD: I have no idea.
ODD: But we’ve got a real problem.
ULRICH: That’s the understatement of the year.
JEREMIE: Oh, this is really bad.
ULRICH: Huh? What is that!
ODD: How about…\Na gigantic invisible eraser?
ULRICH: Let’s get out of here!
ULRICH: Jeremie, do something fast, huh!

DOCTOR 3: In all of my years as a doctor,
DOCTOR 3: this is the first time\NI’ve ever seen that.
JEREMIE: Hey, we’re doing okay.
DEFAULT: (BEEPS)
JEREMIE: Oh, no. The nuclear\Nbattery’s going dead!
JEREMIE: The uranium in the nuclear\Nbattery’s almost all used up,
JEREMIE: so the supercomputer keeps failing,
JEREMIE: and pretty soon\Nit’ll turn off altogether.
ODD: Oh, is that all?
ODD: Then we just have to change the battery.
JEREMIE: A supercomputer is not the\Nsame as a Game Boy, Odd.
JEREMIE: You can’t just pick up a bar of\Nuranium at the corner store.
ULRICH: But isn’t there a kind of\Nemergency backup battery?
JEREMIE: No. I checked.
YUMI: XANA is dying.
JEREMIE: And so is Aelita.
JEREMIE: And all on account\Nof that miserable virus.
JEREMIE: I’m gonna get something to drink.
JEREMIE: Aah!
ODD: Hey, princess.
ODD: Is this the best TV set they could find?
AELITA: Don’t bother trying to cheer me up.
AELITA: I heard what they said in the hallway.

AELITA: (INHALES SHARPLY)
YUMI: Aelita!
DEFAULT: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
JEREMIE: Ulrich, it’s me.
ULRICH: Jeremie, where are you?
ULRICH: Aelita’s just\Nhad another attack.
JEREMIE: That figures.
JEREMIE: I just turned off the supercomputer.
ULRICH: What?!
JEREMIE: Peter Duncan is under XANA’s control.
JEREMIE: He kidnapped me to\Nmake me replace the battery.
ULRICH: That means that\NAelita is safe, too, then.
ULRICH: Fantastic!
JEREMIE: Yeah, except that\Nonce the new battery is in…
JEREMIE: Duncan’s gonna try to kill me.
DOCTOR 1: It’s room 117. Little Aelita!
JEREMIE: The only way to get rid of Duncan
JEREMIE: is for your to go to Lyoko\Nand deactivate the tower.
JEREMIE: Get Aelita out of the hospital,\Nand get here ASAP.
ULRICH: Aelita’s heart can’t take\Nan awful lot more of this.
JEREMIE: I know. So hurry.
DOCTOR 1: Huh?
DEFAULT: (DRAMATIC MUSIC)
JEREMIE: This ought to do the trick.
JEREMIE: Easy…
JEREMIE: Please let Aelita still be alive.

ULRICH: Here I am.
ULRICH: You didn’t think we’d let\Nyou have all the fun
ULRICH: with Peter Duncan, did you?
JEREMIE OFF: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE OFF: Transfer Aelita.
JEREMIE OFF: Transfer Yumi.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.

ODD: Laser arrow!
ODD: One down.
YUMI: Hiyah!
YUMI: Jeremie, we’re gonna\Nneed our vehicles.
JEREMIE: Your rides are on the way.
YUMI: Aah!
JEREMIE: Yumi, you’re down to 10 life points.
JEREMIE: The vehicles are materializing.
JEREMIE OFF: Hurry up, guys!
ODD: We’re doing our best!
ODD: It’s no picnic out here!
YUMI: There’s no time, Odd! Let’s go!
ODD: It must be your lucky day,\Nyou little kankre-creeps!

JEREMIE: H-Aah!
JEREMIE: (CHOKING)
AELITA: Tower deactivated.
JEREMIE: Aah!
ULRICH: Hey, you okay?
YUMI: “Peter Duncan was found unconscious
YUMI: “in front of police headquarters.
YUMI: “The police are investigating,\Nbut for the moment
YUMI: “don’t have any leads as to\Nhow the escaped prisoner
YUMI: ended up outside the police station.”
ULRICH: Even if we did tell them\Nthe truth, they’d never believe us.
ODD: You’re right.
ODD: That’s how it is for unsung\Nheroes like ourselves.
ODD: We gotta act and win\Nand remain in the shadows.
ODD: I guess that’s what being\Na true hero’s all about.
ODD: But someday, everybody’s gonna\Nknow just how brave we are.
ODD: And we’ll reap the real benefits\Nand rewards true heroes deserve.
JEREMIE: Hey, speaking of rewards,\NI just saw Misses Meyer.
ODD: Uh-oh.
JEREMIE: She gave me the results of the math test.
ODD: Great! What did I get?
JEREMIE: 8,650 plus 51 minus 10,000 plus 1,299.
ODD: You mean I got…um…uh…
ODD: Wow!

JEREMIE: No. Zero.
ULRICH: Don’t worry, Odd.
ULRICH: One day, everyone’s gonna know
ULRICH: how “brave” you are\Nby not studying.
ULRICH: And you’ll reap the rewards
ULRICH: that an unsung hero\Nlike you deserves.
YUMI: But don’t hold your breath.
