MRS. HERTZ: (LAUGHING)
JEREMIE: I’ve never seen her laugh so much.
ODD: You’re telling me,\NI’ve never seen her laugh at all!
MRS. HERTZ: (LAUGHING)
MRS. HERTZ: The gas I’ve just inhaled\Nin this small quantity
MRS. HERTZ: is called nitrogen protoxide,\NN2O, ha-ha-ha!
MRS. HERTZ: for those of you interested\Nin chemistry, of course, heh ha!
MRS. HERTZ: Although, it’s better known\Nas laughing gas, ha ha-ha ha ha ha!
MRS. HERTZ: You can see why this gas\Nis sometimes used in hospitals
MRS. HERTZ: to relax patients who are\Ngoing to be operated on, hah hah ha ha ha!
ODD: Not a bad idea.
ODD: Nothing like a laughing attack\Nafter an appendix attack.
MRS. HERTZ: (LAUGHING)
MRS. HERTZ: Let’s try to stay serious!
MRS. HERTZ: In strong doses, this gas\Ncan be highly toxic!
MRS. HERTZ: In provoking very serious\Nmodifications in perception,
MRS. HERTZ: and even lesions in the\Nnervous system,
MRS. HERTZ: sometimes even fatal,\Nso one can, as the saying goes,
MRS. HERTZ: literally die laughing!
MRS. HERTZ: Hahahahahahahahaha!
MRS. HERTZ: Only one thing can\Nneutralize the gas, hah! Water.
MRS. HERTZ: All you need is one drop\Nto volatilize it!
MRS. HERTZ: Enough of that.
MRS. HERTZ: Get out a sheet of paper\Nfor a surprise quiz.
ULRICH: She’s been sulking\Nlike that for two days.
ULRICH: Nothing seem to cheer her up.
ODD: I can try some of my jokes on her.\NThat might do the trick!
ULRICH: I’m not saying you don’t have\Na good sense of humor, Odd,
ULRICH: but I’d rather go and talk to her.
JEREMIE: You think Ulrich will\Nmanage to get her to smile?
ODD: Yeah, as sure as Julia Roberts\Nis gonna call and invite me out to dinner.
JEREMIE: Yeah, I think you’re right.\NShe’s really down.
YUMI: Please, Ulrich, leave me alone.\NI really don’t feel like talking.
ULRICH: But I feel like talking.\NAnd with you.
YUMI: If you like talking so much,\Ntalk to yourself, okay?
SISSI: Don’t worry, Ulrich!\NNot all girls are like Yumi!
ULRICH: Yeah, that’s a shame.
SISSI: Hey, wait, Ulrich!
SISSI: Are you coming tomorrow?\NTo the rehearsal? Huh?
ULRICH: Yeah, I’ll be there,\Nbut not for you, it’s for Odd.
SISSI: For your information, It’s thanks to me\Nthat Odd’s playing the music!
ULRICH: Mhmm.
SISSI: And if you want to be\Npart of the group,
SISSI: the role of Romeo\Nis just ideal for you!
ULRICH: And I suppose that\Nyou, of course, are Juliet.
SISSI: Yes! That’s perfect casting,\Ndon’t you think?
ULRICH: Well, it’s a perfect reason\Nfor me not to play Romeo.

MRS. ISHIYAMA: Oh, it’s you, darling!
MRS. ISHIYAMA: I said to myself, “We couldn’t stay\Nangry with each other for--”
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Oh…hello, Ulrich.
ULRICH: Good evening, mam.
ULRICH: I wanted to talk to Yumi.
ULRICH: What about your dad? Where is he?
YUMI: Staying with a friend from work.
ULRICH: And what was it your parents\Nargued about, huh?
YUMI: I have no idea. My mother\Ntried to tell me, but, I…
YUMI: I didn’t understand,\Nand I’m not sure she did either.
ULRICH: Yeah, those arguments are the worst.
YUMI: I’m really glad that you came.
YUMI: Thanks, Ulrich.\NYou know how to cheer someone up.
AELITA: It’s strange that they’re\Nmad at each other.
AELITA: Yumi and Ulrich\Nalways get along so well.
JEREMIE: You know, Aelita, very often\Npeople who get along well have fights.
AELITA: Really?\NWhat about you and I?
AELITA: Why don’t we ever fight?
JEREMIE: You and I?\NWell, I don’t know, really…
JEREMIE: Anyway, XANA’s been quiet lately.\NToo quiet, don’t you think?
AELITA: What I worry most about\Nare the risks you all take.
AELITA: You know, XANA would\Nreally love to get rid of you.
JEREMIE: Don’t worry, the only one of us\Nwho’s in any real danger today is Odd.
JEREMIE: He’s rehearsing with Sissi.\NNow that’s what I call a risk!
DEFAULT: (SLOW ROMANTIC MUSIC)
HERB: I don’t know if she’ll appear tonight,\Nbut…uh, let’s see, oh!
HERB: I know she loves me! Mhmm.
SISSI: That’s awful!\NIt’s about as flat as a pancake!
HERB: It’s not me, it’s the lines!
NICHOLAS: What’s wrong with the lines, hm!
HERB: Well--!\NI can’t even say ’em!
NICHOLAS: There’s nothing\Nwrong with them, it’s you!
NICHOLAS: You know how long\NI spent on the text?
HERB: Well, my guess would be\Nabout 30 seconds!
NICHOLAS: I dare you to repeat that!
SISSI: Look, I’d rather you repeated\Nyour lines, Herb, and with feeling!
SISSI: Nicholas, there’s no reason\Nfor you to be on stage,
SISSI: and, Odd, you’re playing\Nmuch too fast!
ODD: Sure, if I play a little slower,
ODD: it’ll give me more than enough\Ntime to take a little nap!
SISSI: Hey, keep all your bad jokes\Nfor yourself, huh!
SISSI: Okay, now let’s take it again\Nfrom the top, and try to concentrate!
DEFAULT: (ROMANTIC MUSIC)
HERB: I don’t know if she’ll appear tonight…
HERB: but I know--\Nbut I don't know if she loves me.
HERB: Oh, a guard! On guard!
ODD: HEH-HAH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!
SISSI: What is going on!
SISSI: What is it now, Odd!
HERB: Come on, it wasn’t that bad!
SISSI: You’re not gonna want to laugh\Nwhen I get through with you!
HERB: Get him, Sissi!
ODD: AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!
: AAH-HA-HA-HA-HAHAHAHA!
: AAH-HA-HA--!
ODD: (COUGHING)
SISSI: And don’t bother coming tomorrow, Odd!
SISSI: We’re preforming a tragedy,\Nnot a musical comedy!
ODD: Huh? Hey, wait, uh…
DEFAULT: (RINGS)
DEFAULT: Yumi!
YUMI: Good evening, sir.\NI would like to see my father.
RICHARD: Uh, just a second. I’ll get him.
RICHARD: Uh, would you know why\Nyour mother and father
RICHARD: aren’t talking to each other?
RICHARD: I was afraid of that.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Yum! How nice to see you. Come in.
YUMI: Daddy, I-I want you to come home.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Listen, Yumi.
: This is between your mother and me,\Nand she and I have got to work it out.
YUMI: Oh, yeah? And how?
YUMI: You’re not even willing\Nto talk to each other!
ULRICH: I think I’ve got an idea.
ODD: It was crazy.
: I really didn’t feel like laughing at all,\Nbut it was impossible to stop!
ODD: As soon as Sissi poured water on me,\Nthat was it, I stopped immediately.
JEREMIE: N2O. Laughing gas.
JEREMIE: Miss Hertz said that the only thing\Nthat could volatilize it was water.
ODD: You think this could be a XANA thing?
JEREMIE: You never know.
: Aelita, keep looking around.
AELITA: Okay, but no pulsations for now.
JEREMIE: Let’s go see if the bottle of laughing gas\NMiss Hertz used is still in the science room.
ODD: Kiwi, you stay here.
KIWI: (BARKS)
SISSI: If you’ve come to apologize,\NOdd, don’t bother!
SISSI: Oh. Oh, it you, Ulrich.
: What are you doing here?
ULRICH: Well, I was wondering, Sissi,\Nif there was a part, even a little one
ULRICH: that Yumi could play.
SISSI: And why would I want\Nto give Yumi a part?
ULRICH: Forget that I even asked. Goodbye.
SISSI: No, Ulrich, wait! I…
ULRICH: Hm?
SISSI: There just might be a solution.
JEREMIE: Aelita and me, we never fight.
: You think that’s normal?
ODD: Huh?
: Y-Yeah, no…how do I know?
JEREMIE: You think we’d fight\Nif she lived here in our world?
ODD: What I do think is we’re gonna\Nget caught if you don’t hurry up!
JEREMIE: Bingo.
JEREMIE: It’s empty.
: Guess we ran out of gas…\Nif you pardon the expression.
ODD: Okay, listen.
ODD:  Tomorrow, we’ll go to the factory\Ninstead of the play and check things out.

SISSI: Okay, Yumi.
SISSI: Now come with me\Nso I can show you your costume.
HERB: I can’t believe you stole my part.
ULRICH: It isn’t my fault, Herb, I swear.
HERB: I wonder why I don’t just slug you.
ULRICH: Fear, maybe?
YUMI: Please tell me I don’t\Nlook too dumb, huh?
SISSI: Don’t be silly, you look really stunning.
ULRICH: I hope we’re not\Ndoing this for nothing.
ULRICH: Did you talk to your folks?
YUMI: Yeah, they’re gonna come.
ULRICH: Both of them? How’d you do it?
