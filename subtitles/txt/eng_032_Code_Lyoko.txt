AELITA: But what could…
JIM: Hey, you!
JIM: What are you doing here?
JIM: No one’s allowed in the dormitory\Nwithout my authorization!
JIM: How’d you get in here?
JIM: Uh…well, I…
JIM: Hey!
YUMI: Plain, but not bad.
AELITA: But I wonder who gave it to me.
AELITA: And why.
YUMI: Why?
YUMI: I might have an idea.
YUMI: You know what day it is today?
AELITA: Uh…Tuesday!
YUMI: Yes, but not just any Tuesday!
YUMI: It’s Saint Valentine’s Day!
YUMI: The day all lovers celebrate!
AELITA: Lovers?
YUMI: Yes. And I can guess\Nexactly which boy
YUMI: might want to give you\Na present, can’t you?
ODD: Hey, there’s Aelita!
AELITA: Thanks, Jeremie!
ULRICH: You know, the first time\NI see someone in the morning,
ULRICH: I tend to say, “good morning,”
ULRICH: but then again, maybe I’m\Na little old-fashioned.
AELITA: For the necklace. Thank you.
JEREMIE: The um…necklace?
AELITA: Your Valentine’s Day present!
AELITA: It’s lovely.
JEREMIE: Uh…yeah, um…
JEREMIE: Well, you’re welcome!
JEREMIE: It’s only natural! (CHUCKLES)
AELITA: Well, see you in history class!
JEREMIE: See you, Aelita!
ULRICH: You didn’t give it to her, did you.
JEREMIE: Was it that obvious?
ULRICH: Yeah. But lucky for you,\Nlove has made Aelita blind.
JEREMIE: Oh, come on, Ulrich.
MR. FUMET: Most historians believe\Nthat Valentine’s Day
MR. FUMET: is associated with\Nthe Roman Lupercalia…
JEREMIE: Hey, Ulrich, it wouldn’t be you
JEREMIE: who gave her that necklace\Nby any chance?
ULRICH: You out of your mind or something?
ULRICH: I didn’t even know it was Valentine’s Day.
MR. FUMET: …marked the first day\Nof the Roman spring.
: An important day in ancient Rome.
ULRICH: Jeremie, what rhymes with, uh, tulip?
JEREMIE: I don’t know. Microchip?
JEREMIE: Paperclip? Hypocrite?
ULRICH: Okay, nevermind.
JEREMIE: What are you writing?
ULRICH: Nothing!
JEREMIE: A poem?
ULRICH: No.
JEREMIE: Is it for Yumi?
ULRICH: No!
ULRICH: It’s…biology homework.
JEREMIE: Biology homework that rhymes, huh?
JEREMIE: That’s interesting.
JEREMIE: Odd, the necklace. It wasn’t you, was it?
ODD: Do I have to remind you that Aelita\Nis supposed to be my cousin?
JEREMIE: Yes, except that we both\Nknow she isn’t your cousin.
ODD: Yeah? What is it was me?
ODD: Aelita isn’t your property as far as I know.
JEREMIE: Aha! You see! You admit it!
ODD: I didn’t admit anything.
JEREMIE: You just said it was you!
ODD: Hey, have you gone bananas?
ODD: Your eyesight’s not great,\Nbut your hearing’s worse!
JEREMIE: I--
MR. FUMET: (CLEARS THROAT)
MR. FUMET: If you have more important subjects\Nto discuss than today’s lesson,
MR. FUMET: I suggest you do so\Nin the principal’s office!
MR. DELMAS: In your case, Odd,\Nthis comes as no surprise.
MR. DELMAS: But you, Jeremie, a\Nmodel student in all areas,
MR. DELMAS: I simply don’t understand.
JEREMIE: Well, I…
MR. DELMAS: Two hours of detention should help you
MR. DELMAS: to find some more convincing arguments.
MR. DELMAS: And you’re lucky it’s Valentine’s Day\Nor I’d have given you at least four.
JEREMIE: I’m still waiting for an answer.
ODD: Hey, why don’t we call a truce, okay?
JEREMIE: Was it you who gave her the necklace?
JEREMIE: Yes or no?
ODD: Okay, then. No truce.
ULRICH: Come on, Einstein. It’s stupid to\Nfight over such a little thing.
YUMI: He’s right.
YUMI: What’s more, Odd has every right\Nto give Aelita a present if he wants to.
SISSI: Uh, Ulrich?
SISSI: Could I talk to you for a second?
ULRICH: (SIGHS) Well, only if\Nit’s really important.
ULRICH: For me?
ULRICH: Is this for Valentine’s Day?
SISSI: (LAUGHS) No, it’s for Christmas!
SISSI: Of course it’s for Valentine’s Day!
SISSI: What do you think, hm?
SISSI: Come on! Open it, stupid!

ULRICH: I must be dreaming.
WILLIAM: Yumi, I’ve got something for you.
YUMI: Oh! Thank you, William!
ULRICH: I must be dreaming.
ULRICH: Sissi, I wrote you a little poem.
ULRICH: “To tell you how much I flip

ULRICH: “And long to hold you in my arms

SISSI: It’s so beautiful!
YUMI: William!
YUMI: Your bouquet is beautiful!
YUMI: How did you know\Nthat I liked roses!
WILLIAM: I didn’t.
WILLIAM: But I figured you were\Nlike all the other girls.
ULRICH: How romantic, William! (LAUGHS)
YUMI: Just a bit awkward!
YUMI: Thank you, William.
YUMI: You couldn’t have made me happier.
MUSIC: (UNNERVING MUSIC)
JEREMIE: Look, it’s ridiculous to fight\Nover such a puny little thing.
JEREMIE: William had every right to give Yumi a present
JEREMIE: and so did Sissi with Ulrich, right?

JEREMIE: You mean to say it…
JEREMIE: it just came to you just like that?
AELITA: Let’s just say that your necklace inspired me.
JEREMIE: The problem is that given\Neverybody’s bad mood today,
JEREMIE: I doubt that Odd or Ulrich or Yumi\Nare gonna want to go with you.
AELITA: I can go by myself!
JEREMIE: No, it’s too dangerous.
JEREMIE: Don’t forget, XANA’s\Nready to go to any extreme
JEREMIE: to steal your memory, Aelita.
AELITA: Please, Jeremie.
AELITA: I'm positive I'm on the right track.
AELITA: And with an Overboard, I’m sure\NI can get away from the monsters.
AELITA: Even the latest ones\Nlike the scyphozoa.
AELITA: Please?

AELITA: No way. I’m heading north.
JEREMIE: But…I don’t understand.
JEREMIE: You’re supposed to go to sector five!
AELITA: Sorry, Yumi.
JEREMIE: Yumi?
JEREMIE: Aelita, what’s going on!
JEREMIE: Yumi, can you hear me?\NAre you okay?
YUMI: I’d be lying if I said I was.
YUMI: What’s gotten into her?
JEREMIE: I don’t know! She’s lost it!
JEREMIE: You’ve absolutely got to stop her.
JEREMIE: She’s headed due north.
YUMI: Okay. I’ll try.

SISSI: What?
ULRICH: Uh, well, leave.
YUMI: Okay, Jeremie. I see her.
JEREMIE: Yumi, do you know how\NAelita got that necklace?
YUMI: I think she found it on her doorstep.
YUMI: Do you think XANA could’ve put it there?
JEREMIE: I’m launching a superscan.\NWe’ll know in a minute.
JEREMIE: In my opinion, it’s that dumb necklace\Nthat gives XANA control over Aelita.
JEREMIE: He wants to lead her\Nstraight to the scyphozoa.
JEREMIE: Oh, no. That’s exactly\Nwhat I was afraid of.
JEREMIE: Looks like XANA’s activated a tower.
YUMI: Don’t panic, Jeremie.
YUMI: I’ve just about caught up to her.
YUMI: And I was about to say this was too easy.
YUMI: Jeremie, I don’t want to sound pessimistic,
YUMI: but if Ulrich and Odd could hurry up a bit!
ULRICH: You see, Jim, Aelita’s got 104 fever,
ULRICH: so naturally she wants to see her cousin.
ULRICH: He’s her only family here!
JIM: A minute ago, it was 103!
ULRICH: Right! Her temperature\Nkeeps going up by the minute!

JEREMIE: I…well, uh…it’s a tunnel!
JEREMIE: We’re about to get cut off!
ULRICH: How did you manage that with the principal?

YUMI: (YELLS)
JEREMIE: You swear you’ll what?
YUMI: Um, nothing.
ODD: Can’t do without me, huh?
ODD: You won’t get mad\Nif I save Aelita, will you?
ULRICH: Odd.
JEREMIE: No, let him, Ulrich. He’s right.
JEREMIE: I was being stupid.
ODD: I don’t blame you, Jeremie. I understand.
ODD: I’m a pretty charming guy.
ODD: It’s only natural you’d be jealous of me.

YUMI: if I fall into the digital sea?
JEREMIE: If I were you, I’d avoid it.
YUMI: Well then if you could help me\Nout of here, I’d appreciate it!

JEREMIE: I’m doing all I can!

ODD: Laser arrow!
ODD: Aelita! Stop!
ODD: Hey, that’s cheating!
ULRICH: Jeremie, we’re never gonna make it.
YUMI: You’ve got to think of something.
JEREMIE: I do have one idea, but it’s awfully risky.
JEREMIE: Odd, aim for Aelita.
ODD: Huh? Are you crazy!
ULRICH: Hey, don’t forget that if\NAelita loses all her life points,
ULRICH: she’ll disappear forever!
JEREMIE: XANA wants her memory.
JEREMIE: He won’t risk losing that.
JEREMIE: Deep down, he wants her alive\Nas much as we do.

JEREMIE: some interesting\Ninformation about XANA.
ULRICH: Anyway, Aelita, from now on,
ULRICH: you don’t take any presents from anyone.
AELITA: Promise.
AELITA: You know, Jeremie saved my life,
AELITA: And that’s the nicest Valentine’s\Npresent anyone can hope for.
ODD: Yeah, but that sure won’t save him\Nfrom being suspended
ODD: for missing four hours of detention.
ODD: The principal’s not gonna be\Ntoo happy about that!
ODD: But I’m sure there’s a solution!
ULRICH: Hey, what are you looking at me for?
ULRICH: I’m really happy to be going\Nto the concert with you,
ULRICH: but you won’t forget to talk to\Nyour father beforehand, huh?
SISSI: Don’t worry. I’ll get Jeremie out of this.
ODD: Now that’s a real friend.
ODD: Ready to sacrifice himself for his pal.
JEREMIE: Are you sure he’s sacrificing himself\Nas much as all that?
JEREMIE: He doesn’t seem to be bothered by it.
YUMI: Maybe not.
YUMI: But it was for me that he wrote the poem.
YUMI: Poor Sissi!
