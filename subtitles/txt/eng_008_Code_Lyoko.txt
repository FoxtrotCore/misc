JEREMIE: Totally ridiculous.
ULRICH: Wow, that was great!
YUMI: I thought the special effects\Nwere pretty good,
YUMI: but, well, it wasn’t scary enough.
YUMI: You’re kidding!
YUMI: How come your\Nteeth were chattering?
YUMI: For the sound effects?
MR. DELMAS: Dear students,\Nyour attention, please.
MR. DELMAS: I would like you all\Nto give a warm welcome
MR. DELMAS: to the director of the\Nfilm you’ve just seen,
MR. DELMAS: and which we’ve all found\Nvery…interesting.
MR. DELMAS: And here he is now,\NJames Finson,
MR. DELMAS: who is honoring us\Nwith his presence today
MR. DELMAS: to discuss his work in the\Nfascinating field of cinema.
MR. FINSON: That’s right, and I’m also here\Nto look for locations
MR. FINSON: to shoot for my new film.
MR. FINSON: In fact, I heard there’s an\Nold factory around here
MR. FINSON: that nobody uses anymore,\Nwhich I’m very interested in.
JEREMIE: A factory?\NOh, no. Not ours!
DEFAULT: Great! Thank you sir.
JEREMIE: If this Finson guy finds out\Nabout our supercomputer,
JEREMIE: we’re in trouble.
YUMI: And that means we absolutely\Nhave to stop him from using it.
ODD: Yeah, sure we do, but how?
ULRICH: Nothing to worry about!
ULRICH: I got an idea.
ODD: How come every time he says\Nthere’s nothing to worry about,
ODD: I get worried?\NAnd I mean worried.
SISSI: Oh, I’m so glad\Nto meet you, Mister Finson.
SISSI: I just love your films.\NI’m a big fan of yours.
MR. FINSON: Oh, really?
MR. FINSON: Well, I can’t argue with your taste!\NI like my films, too. What’s your name?
SISSI: Um, why don’t you just write,
SISSI: “To Sissi, a rising star\Nwho I’m going to give
SISSI: the leading role to\Nin my next film.”
MR. FINSON: I think I’m going to write,
MR. FINSON: “To Sissi, who’s\Ngot a lot of nerve.”
SISSI: And a lot of talent!
MR. FINSON: Well, I’m very sorry, Sissi,\Nbut the casting is over.
MR. FINSON: The parts have all been distributed.
MR. FINSON: So, better luck next time, huh?
ULRICH: Uh, hello, sir, the factory\Nyou were talking about,
ULRICH: I was wondering, uh,\Nif you had already been there.
MR. FINSON: No, but I’m going to\Nstart my scouting later today.
ULRICH: Well, you see, I know the place\Ninside out, and, uh
ULRICH: I really don’t think\Nyou could find a better guide.
: (CHUCKLES)
MR. FINSON: It looks like everyone\Nin this school has a lot of nerve!
MR. FINSON: Fantastic!\NIt’s even better than I thought!
ULRICH: Yeah, it looks alright,\Nbut the trouble is, it’s falling apart!
ULRICH: Hopefully the ceiling\Nwon’t fall on our heads!
ULRICH: That’s great.\NI love a dangerous shoot!
ULRICH: That’s what I always look for--
ULRICH: an actor’s always\Nbetter under pressure.
ULRICH: Uh, Mister Finson, you’d better\Nwatch out for your equipment.
ULRICH: It’s crawling with rats here!
MR. FINSON: Rats? That’s lucky!
MR. FINSON: I’ve got some big scenes\Nto shoot with rats in them.
ODD: Conclusion--never trust Ulrich when he\Nsays there’s nothing to worry about.
JEREMIE: Yeah, he tried to gross him out.\NInstead, he’s even more excited.
ULRICH: You’re right, it’s a great set!
ULRICH: Too bad about all that\Nuranium they stored here
ULRICH: for so many years and years.
ULRICH: Maybe one day it won’t be\Nradioactive anymore!
MR. FINSON: Mhmm. Do you know where\Nthis freight elevator leads to?
ULRICH: Oh, that old thing?\NIt stopped working ages ago!
ULRICH: Anyway, they say that\Nwhen it was working, it--
ODD: (GHOSTLY MOANING)
MR. FINSON: What was that noise?
ULRICH: That noise? Oh, it’s nothing!
ULRICH: Nothing at all!
ULRICH: Uh, well, there is an old rumor\Nthat this factory is haunted by ghosts,
ULRICH: but I don’t believe\Na word of that, although…
MR. FINSON: (CHUCKLES)
MR. FINSON: This place just keeps getting\Nbetter and better than I thought!
MR. FINSON: And you seem to know\Nevery nook and cranny of it.
MR. FINSON: I know!
MR. FINSON: How would you like to work\Nas a technical advisor on the film?
ODD: Yes, do it!\NSay yes, say yes!
ULRICH: Are you serious?
MR. FINSON: Of course I am!
ULRICH: Um, well, it would be\Na great honor, sir!
ULRICH: The only problem is the principal\Nwould never let me miss my classes.
MR. FINSON: Let me talk to him!
HERB: Sissi, your father will never\Nlet Ulrich miss even one hour of school.
SISSI: Hm. We’ll see about that.
SISSI: Nothing’s gonna stop me\Nfrom becoming a big movie star.
MR. FINSON: Wow, he said no. Incredible.
MR. FINSON: I even promised to\Nput his name in the credits!
SISSI: Uh, mister Finson?
SISSI: Can I talk to you for a second?
JEREMIE: I don’t believe it!
JEREMIE: Sissi got a part in Finson’s film!
ULRICH: Yeah, in exchange for\Nconvincing her dad to let me skip school.
ODD: Ulrich and Sissi\Nworking together on a film!
ODD: This could be the beginning\Nof a great romance!
ULRICH: Yeah, right.
ULRICH: She won’t leave me alone for one second.
JEREMIE: Your real job is\Nto be there in the factory
JEREMIE: making sure that nobody\Ndiscovers our lab.
AELITA: Come on, it’s not going\Nto be as bad as all that!
SISSI: Are you sure it’s not too heavy?
SISSI: When I think that I’m about\Nto become a big star,
SISSI: and that you, Ulrich honey,
SISSI: are lucky enough\Nto witness the event live,
: oh, I envy you. I really do!
SISSI: Uh, hello!
SISSI: Mister Finson is expecting us.
WOMAN: Do you have cell phones,\Nby any chance?
SISSI: Uh, cell phones?
SISSI: Why, of course!\NHow could you think we didn’t?
WOMAN: Confiscated.\NMister Finson’s orders.
MAN: During the shooting,\Nit’s forbidden to communicate
MAN: with the outside world\Nwithout Finson’s OK.
MAN: That’s so there are no leaks\Nabout the script or newspaper gossip.
MAN: That’s also why everyone sleeps here\Nwith guards at the entrance.
MAN: Apart from all that, it’s a lot of fun.
ULRICH: Yes, but what if we have to\Nget in touch with, uh,
ULRICH: our parents, for example,\Nin case there’s a problem, huh?
MAN: When you shoot with James Finson,\Nthere’s never a problem!
SISSI: Cut off from the rest of the world!
SISSI: That’s so incredibly romantic.
SISSI: It’s almost like being\Nalone on a desert island!
ULRICH: Fantastic. I can’t wait.
MR. FINSON: Well, it’s time for you all\Nto meet the main character of my movie.
MR. FINSON: Prepare yourselves for a big surprise!
MR. FINSON: Don’t be shy.
MR. FINSON: Tell me what you think.\NIt’s my best monster yet, right!
MR. FINSON: And to top it all off, I’ve invented\Na way to make him squirt
MR. FINSON: slimy, disgusting threads of goo.
MR. FINSON: It’ll knock your socks off! You’ll see!
ULRICH: Funny, but it makes me think of\Nthe alien in that film, uh,
ULRICH: I can’t remember the name--
MR. FINSON: My creature is unique, young man!
MR. FINSON: And my movie will be\Nlike no other ever made!
MR. FINSON: Hmph!
SISSI: Mister Finson?
SISSI: I’m very anxious to get my script,\Nif you don’t mind.
SISSI: I’d like to start working on my lines.
SISSI: You see, we professionals are very serious.
MR. FINSON: Oh, why of course!
MR. FINSON: Just one second, here it comes.
MR. FINSON: There.
SISSI: Thank you.
SISSI: Aaaah!
MR. FINSON: You’ve got it, kid!\NYou’ll be the alien’s first victim.
MR. FINSON: 20 seconds on the screen, yes,\Nbut 20 seconds of glory!
MR. FINSON: Gorey glory, too!
JEREMIE: Hey, what are you doing in the lab?
JEREMIE: Anything wrong?
ULRICH: They took my cell phone away.
ULRICH: Finson’s totally paranoid.
ULRICH: It won’t be easy staying in touch with you.
SISSI: Well, well!
SISSI: What kind of a weird place is this?
JEREMIE: Hey, Ulrich,
JEREMIE: please tell me that that wasn’t\NSissi’s voice I just heard.
ULRICH: Uh, Sissi, listen.
ULRICH: I can’t explain this to you, but uh,\Nyou can’t tell anyone about this or else--
SISSI: Or else what?
SISSI: A monster’s gonna squirt\Ngoopy goo all over my face, huh, Ulrich?
ULRICH: Jeremie, we’ve got\Na big problem here!
JEREMIE: Ulrich, what’s going on?\NWhat’s that noise!
ULRICH: Follow me, hurry up!
: Come on!
JEREMIE: Ulrich, what is going on? Answer me!
ULRICH: Up there!
ULRICH: You’ve got to climb up. I’ll follow you.
ULRICH: Let’s go, we can’t stay here.
ULRICH: Through here, come on.
JEREMIE: XANA’s up to something.
JEREMIE: A tower’s been activated.
JEREMIE: I’m launching a scan\Nto localize the tower.
JEREMIE: I’ll wake Odd, call Yumi,\Nand we’ll be on our way.
MUSIC: (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC)
MAN: Who’s the moron that--
MAN: Oh, it’s you, boss! I’m sorry!
MR. FINSON: Not bad, huh?
MR. FINSON: I just composed it for the film.
MR. FINSON: Okay, all you lazy bones.
MR. FINSON: Let’s go, we’ve got\Na movie to make!
MR. FINSON: Go get the alien.
MAN: Boss!
MAN: Better come and take a look, uh,
MAN: we’ve got a little problem here.
MR. FINSON: A little problem, huh?
MR. FINSON: You call this a little problem!?
MR. FINSON: Go and find him, you understand!
MR. FINSON: He couldn’t have\Nwalked out on his own!
MR. FINSON: Go find him!
WOMAN: Mister Finson, the two youngsters\Nhave both disappeared.
SISSI: Finson’s alien monster…It’s come alive!
SISSI: How can a machine made of\Nplastic and rubber come alive--!
DEFAULT: (SNARLING)
SISSI: Aaaah!
YUMI: I’m gonna try and find\NUlrich and Sissi.
YUMI: We’ll stay in contact, okay?
JEREMIE: Right.
JEREMIE: Aelita?
JEREMIE: Odd’s about to make the plunge.
JEREMIE: How do things look?
AELITA: Pretty bad.\NYou were right, Jeremie.
AELITA: XANA is up to no good again.
JEREMIE: I’ve localized the tower.\N It’s in the polar region.
WOMAN: Do you really think it was\Nthose two kids who stole the alien?
MAN: If it was them, they better hope\NFinson doesn’t find them.
ODD: Okay, Jeremie. I’m in.
JEREMIE: Aelita’s on her way to the polar region.
JEREMIE: That’s where the scan\Nlocalized the tower.
JEREMIE: I’ll launch the transfer.
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE: Scanner.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
AELITA: Odd!
ODD: Nice little place,\Nbut it could use a little heat.
AELITA: The tower plateau is in that direction.
AELITA: Let’s go. If we run, it’ll warm you up!
SISSI: I don’t get this at all.
SISSI: Why did he leave us alone\Nwhen he could have just as easily--
ULRICH: I’m pretty sure he wanted\Nto use us as bait to attract the others.
SISSI: When you say the others, Ulrich,
SISSI: do you mean the whole gang of yours?
SISSI: But why?
YUMI: Ulrich, Sissi!
ULRICH: Ah, Yumi!
YUMI: Whatever you do,\Ndon’t move a muscle!
ULRICH: Boy, aren’t you funny.
SISSI: Oh, Yumi, I never thought\NI’d be saying this to you one day,
SISSI: but I’m actually very\Nglad to see you for once.
ULRICH: You can kiss and make up later.
: We’ve got to go,\Nor XANA’s gonna get his way.
MR. FINSON: Come out of there!
MR. FINSON: And make it snappy!
JEREMIE: Odd, Aelita, watch out.\NXANA’s sent his monsters out.
JEREMIE: Just behind you, there’s\Na swarm of them armed with lasers.
JEREMIE: 20 life points per impact.
ODD: A little battle’s bound to keep me warm!
ODD: Talk about a reception committee! Wow!
ODD: Laser arrow!
AELITA: Odd, watch out!
ODD: Let’s get going.
JEREMIE: Yumi! Yumi, can you hear me?
JEREMIE: Where are you?
JEREMIE: Come on, answer me, Yumi!\NPlease answer!
MR. FINSON: Tell me right now!\NWhat have you done with my alien!
MR. FINSON: Huh?
: But w--
ULRICH: Let’s go!
MAN: Boss! Did you find the--
MR. FINSON: Don’t let them get away!
MR. FINSON: Get a move on!
MR. FINSON: Stop! I created you!
MR. FINSON: You have to obey me, you hear!
YUMI: Jeremie, it’s Yumi.
YUMI: Yeah, I did find them,
YUMI: but XANA’s taken possession\Nof a monster who’s gonna be here--
JEREMIE: Odd, Yumi and Ulrich\Nare in big trouble.
JEREMIE: There’s not much time!
ODD: Wow, that sure is steep.
ODD: But we have no choice.
ODD: Yahoo! Ha-ha! Incredible!
ODD: Wow, what a fabulous ride!
ODD: Ha-ha-ha!
ODD: Woo-hoo!
ODD: Hey, I think I just might\Nsettle down and live here!
ODD: Yeehaw!
AELITA: Aaah!
ODD: By the way, Jeremie,
ODD: what’s at the end of this?
JEREMIE: Well, I uh…
ODD: Oh, I get the idea.\NGeronim-o-o-o-o-o!
JEREMIE: At any rate, the tower\Nis pretty close now.
ODD: Thanks for the info, Jeremie.
ULRICH: You think he’s called it quits?
YUMI: I doubt it.
SISSI: For once I have a chance\Nto show how how talented I am,
SISSI: and that mechanical monster\Nhas to go nuts!
SISSI: And what’s more,\Nhe decides to pick on me!
SISSI: I don’t understand!
SISSI: What did I ever do to that plastic\Npiece of junk to deserve that, huh?
YUMI: Hey, Ulrich, you think you could\Nget her to keep still for a second?
ULRICH: Shh.
ODD: Well, Aelita, any sign of that tower yet?
AELITA: Yes, but I may be seeing double.
ODD: Jeremie, there are two towers!
JEREMIE: How can that be?
JEREMIE: I only saw one on the holomap.
AELITA: XANA must’ve\Ndone that to confuse us.
ODD: Well, we’ve gotta choose one.
ODD: And pronto, too.
YUMI: Hello, Jeremie?
YUMI: Well, have you got any news for us?
JEREMIE: Yumi, what’s going on?
JEREMIE: Answer me, Yumi.
JEREMIE: Yumi! Yumi--
JEREMIE: Odd!
ODD: I know what you’re gonna tell me--\N“Hurry up!”
ODD: Well, for your information,
ODD: we’re not exactly\Nhaving a tea party here!
ODD: Get down!
ODD: Aelita, you’ve got to choose\None of the towers now.
ODD: I can’t hold them off much longer.
AELITA: Okay.
ODD: Laser arrow.
ODD: Yahoo!
ODD: Take that!
ODD: Oh no, I’m out of arrows.
AELITA: Here I go.
AELITA: Jeremie,
AELITA: if I happen to choose the wrong tower,\Nit’ll be all over, you know that.
JEREMIE: I have faith in you, Aelita
SISSI: Ulrich!
AELITA: Jeremie, I’m sorry.\NI chose the wrong one.
AELITA: No! Wait!
JEREMIE: Return to the past now.
ULRICH: Great idea to use\Nthe factory for a movie.
MR. FINSON: Thanks.
MR. FINSON: I must confess that my ideas are,\NI say this with great modesty,
MR. FINSON: absolutely ingenious. Here.
ULRICH: It makes a great set.
ULRICH: By the way, you do know that\Na film was shot here once before?
MR. FINSON: You’re kidding.
ULRICH: No, a science fiction movie.\NWith an alien!
ULRICH: And a fabulous picture, too!
MR. FINSON: No, no. I’ve given it some thought,
MR. FINSON: and I don’t think\Nthe factory’s a good idea.
MR. FINSON: Besides, it wasn’t my idea\Nin the first place!
MR. FINSON: What’s that?
MR. FINSON: How dare you accuse me\Nof lying to you!
MR. FINSON: I can find another producer, you know!
MR. FINSON: I am not upset!
