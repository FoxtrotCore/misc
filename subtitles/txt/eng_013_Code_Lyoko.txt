JEREMIE: Targeting OK.
JEREMIE: This time, it’s gonna work!
JEREMIE: Ready, Aelita?
AELITA: Ready.
JEREMIE: Here we go.
JEREMIE: It’s working!
YUMI: Ready?
ODD: Go on, Kiwi! Go on, fetch!
YUMI: Anyone seen Jeremie\Nthis morning?
ODD: I think he spent the night\Nin the laboratory.
ODD: He was working on\Nsomething “really important.”
ODD: Hmm.
DEFAULT: Aelita!
YUMI: Hiyah!
ULRICH: Hey, I thought it was timeout!
YUMI: Oh! Guess I forgot!
JEREMIE: Hey, guys!
JEREMIE: Guess what I did last night!
ODD: Let’s see, now…
ODD: It’s got something to do with\Nmaterializing…Aelita?
JEREMIE: That’s right.
JEREMIE: Say, how did you guess, Odd?
JEREMIE: Well, guys, I finally did it.
JEREMIE: I decided to tackle the problem\Nin a different way.
JEREMIE: You wouldn’t believe it, but…
ULRICH: Well, tell us!\NDid you do it or not?
JEREMIE: I sure did!
ULRICH: Hm…
ULRICH: You materialized a test tube.
JEREMIE: No, airhead!\NLook inside, will you?
ODD: A hair?
ODD: You mean you materialized one hair?
JEREMIE: Yep. That’s right, Odd.
JEREMIE: To be exact, it’s a hair of…
JEREMIE: Aelita’s.
ULRICH: What? A real hair?
YUMI: But how did you manage that?
JEREMIE: Well, I chose a hair because\Nit’s a simple anatomical structure,
JEREMIE: but which contains aelita’s\Ncomplete genetic computer code
JEREMIE: according to a well-known fractal
JEREMIE: whose recurrences are comparable\Nto the genetic code of a human,
JEREMIE: which enabled me to make\Na physiological number transfer
JEREMIE: onto one part of the program\Nalready pretargeted and defragmented.
JEREMIE: And that’s that.
JEREMIE: Simple enough, right?
JEREMIE: Do you follow?
ODD: No.
JEREMIE: No, it’s not simple enough,\Nor no you don’t follow?
ODD: Uh…no means that\Nwe take your word for it.
DEFAULT: -Mhmm.\N-Mhmm.
JEREMIE: No problem.
JEREMIE: It’ll become clear when\NAelita’s here in flesh and blood.
JEREMIE: Better get ready, Aelita.
AELITA: Okay, Jeremie.
ULRICH: Huh?
ULRICH: You’re gonna materialize her now?
JEREMIE: What do you think?\NI’m not gonna wait until next year.
JEREMIE: The hair was just a test\Nbefore we do the whole thing.
YUMI: Listen, making a hair appear is one thing.\NMaterializing Aelita is not the same.
JEREMIE: Look, you want to spend\Nyour whole life fighting XANA?
JEREMIE: Once Aelita’s been materialized,\Nwe can unplug XANA once and for all
JEREMIE: and lead normal lives.
JEREMIE: So I say it’s worth trying.
JEREMIE: How can that be?
JEREMIE: I planned everything so perfectly.
ULRICH: You’re almost there, Jeremie.
ULRICH: In a few days, you’ll be all set.\NYou’ll see.
ODD: Hey, come on, you guys.
ODD: If we don’t materialize in a\Ncouple of minutes in the classroom,
ODD: we’re not gonna last a few days!
SFX: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
JEREMIE: You know, I’d have sworn\Nthat it’ll work this time.
YUMI: But…
YUMI: if the computer gene code of the hair\Ngives you enough information
YUMI: to find the parameters for materialization,\Nwell then what’s the problem?
JEREMIE: I wish I knew.
JEREMIE: I’m doing something wrong.
JEREMIE: The only way to find out\Nis to start over.
ODD: No, don’t do that!
ODD: You’re only a hair’s breadth away!
: (SNICKERS)
YUMI: Can you ever be serious, Odd?
ULRICH: By the way, Odd,\Nspeaking of hair,
ULRICH: your dog sheds\Nan awful lot of them.
ULRICH: most of them end up\Non my bed, too.
ODD: What’s the big deal\Nabout two or three hairs?
ULRICH: Two or three?
ULRICH: With all the hairs he sheds,\NI could knit you another Kiwi!
SISSI: Hello.
SISSI: Did you say dog?
SISSI: Oh, I really adore dogs.
SISSI: Hey, can I sit down?
ULRICH: No.
SISSI: You know, I’m so crazy about dogs\Nthat I’m ready to keep my mouth shut
SISSI: about the one Odd’s hiding in his room.
SISSI: That is, if you promise\Nto be nicer to me, of course.
YUMI: Listen, Sissi, I’m warning you,\Nif you say anything about Kiwi, I’ll--
JEREMIE: You okay, Yumi?
YOLANDA: There we are.
YOLANDA: It’s nothing serious.\NThe cut isn’t very deep.
YOLANDA: Here. Put this on it, please.
YUMI: It’s incredible.\NI barely squeezed the glass.
YUMI: They’re pretty fragile, I guess.
ULRICH: Fragile, huh?
ULRICH: We’re not talking about venetian crystal.
ULRICH: Lunchroom plastic’s more like it.
ULRICH: Anyway, I know what I’m in for\Nif I get on your nerves.
SFX: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
ULRICH: What?
ULRICH: On our way.
JEREMIE: I don’t believe it. It’s a disaster!
ULRICH: What is?
JEREMIE: I was trying to figure out\Nwhy the materialization didn’t work,
JEREMIE: and I realized that\NAelita’s program is all full of bugs.
JEREMIE: When I materialized the hair, I…\NI hit a button I shouldn’t have,
JEREMIE: and so I…I damaged\Nthe annex programs.
YUMI: Annex? That doesn’t sound so bad.
JEREMIE: That’s what you think.
JEREMIE: The part of the program linking Aelita\Nto the towers is screwed up.
JEREMIE: If Aelita enters the Lyoko code,\Nshe’ll be completely reformatted!
ULRICH: Meaning?
JEREMIE: She’ll disappear forever.
AELITA: You know, Jeremie,\Na program can be debugged.
AELITA: We can do it together.
JEREMIE: What if XANA attacks\Nbefore we’re done?
ODD: That means you gotta work fast, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Okay. Make up a story\Nto tell to the teachers.
JEREMIE: I’m not leaving this computer\Nuntil I’ve solved the problem.
ODD: You think they can do it?
ULRICH: What do you think?\NWe’ve got two geniuses at work.
KIWI: (BARKING)
ULRICH: Hey, Odd, if you don’t get Kiwi\Nto calm down, they’re gonna find him.
ODD: Hey, quiet, Kiwi!
KIWI: You heard me, quiet down!
KIWI: (BARKING)
ODD: What’s the matter?\NDid you smell something?
ODD: Kiwi!
ULRICH: Whoa!
ODD: Did you do that?
JIM: Well, maybe it was\Na ball that did it.
JIM: And you, of course,\Ndidn’t see anything.
ODD: I couldn’t have seen anything, Jim,\Nbecause…I wasn’t here!
JIM: Maybe so.
JIM: But since all the rooms\Nare off-limits during the day,
JIM: how come you knew\Nabout the window?
JIM: Ulrich, clean up your bed.\NThere’s hair all over it.
YUMI: What happened?
ULRICH: Everything’s cool.\NJim didn’t spot Kiwi.
ULRICH: But it was close.
: Kiwi will have to\Nstay with Jeremie for a while.
AELITA: Why don’t you scan\Nthe STR connection blocks?
JEREMIE: I already did.
JEREMIE: That’s not where I went wrong.
JEREMIE: Stop chewing my slipper!
JEREMIE: Oh. Sorry, Aelita.
JEREMIE: I was talking to the dog.
JEREMIE: When he’s around,\Nit’s hard to concentrate.
AELITA: What is it?
JEREMIE: Oh, nothing!
JEREMIE: Give that back to me! Give it back!
JEREMIE: That dog.
JEREMIE: He took my…my handkerchief.
KIWI: (BARKING)
JEREMIE: Oh, take him away, please!
KIWI: (HOWLING)
SISSI: Oh, that mutt.
SISSI: I was just passing by, and…
ODD: I always said Sissi’s head\Nwas full of plaster.
JEREMIE: I’m heading for the lab.
JEREMIE: With the dog barking\Nand the school falling apart,
JEREMIE: I can’t work in my room.
JEREMIE: See ya.
YUMI: I hope he finds the right solution\Nbefore XANA attacks again.
: I’ll see you guys tomorrow.
ODD: Hello? Anybody home?
ULRICH: All these things happening\Nare really weird.
ULRICH: First, Yumi’s glass breaks,\Nthen the window gets shattered,
ULRICH: and now the ceiling.\NYou think it’s XANA?
ODD: Maybe it’s just coincidence.
ULRICH: Maybe.
JEREMIE: I’m back, Aelita.
AELITA: Oh, no. I don’t believe it. Not now!
JEREMIE: Okay, we can get back to work.
JEREMIE: Aelita?
JEREMIE: Are you there?
AELITA: It’s XANA!
AELITA: He’s launched an attack!
JEREMIE: Are you…are you sure?
JEREMIE: Oh, no!
JEREMIE: It can’t be! Not now!
MR. DELMAS: I’ve never seen such a thing\Nin my entire career.
JIM: You think humidity\Ncould’ve caused it, sir?
MR. DELMAS: I don’t know.
MR. DELMAS: It doesn’t look very damp.
JIM: The dog!
JIM: I’ve been after him\Nfor a long time!
JIM: What the…
JIM: Whoa!
MR. DELMAS: Jim, we have to\Nevacuate the building.
JIM: Mhmm.
ULRICH: It’s XANA for sure.
ODD: Oh, yeah. It’s him.
ODD: How does he do it?
ULRICH: Your guess is as good as mine.
ULRICH: But you heard Sissi.
ULRICH: Kiwi began barking\Njust before the ceiling fell.
ODD: That might be a lead.
ODD: With the window was the same.
ULRICH: Maybe Kiwi can\Nfeel the attacks coming.
ODD: Or maybe he can feel them\Nlike a kind of ultrasound.
ULRICH: Jeremie.
JEREMIE: XANA alert.
ULRICH: That’s what we thought.
JEREMIE: Warn Yumi.
ULRICH: Be right there.
ULRICH: It’s real this time.
ULRICH: XANA has woken up.
MR. DELMAS: Your attention, please.
MR. DELMAS: Due to a danger\Nof structural accident,
MR. DELMAS: please evacuate the building calmly,\Nand leave the immediate area.
MR. DELMAS: No one will be permitted\Nto enter the building
MR. DELMAS: until further notice.
ODD: Kiwi! He’s in Jeremie’s room.
ODD: I’ll go and get him.
ULRICH: See you at the lab.
SFX: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
YUMI: Hello?
YUMI: Hi, Ulrich.
YUMI: What?
YUMI: Uh, I’m not really ready yet.
YUMI: Okay, I’ll hurry.
ODD: Kiwi? Where are you? Come on!
ODD: Diggity dog!
MILLY: Huh?
MILLY: Didn’t anyone ever\Nteach you to knock, huh?
ODD: Didn’t you hear the principal?
ODD: You gotta get out!
ODD: The whole building may collapse!
MILLY: Come on, cut it out!
ODD: No, I swear! I’m not joking!
TAMIYA: Hey, what's wrong with your dog?
SFX: (RUMBLING)
ODD: About face.
JEREMIE: Ulrich!
JEREMIE: How are things going over there?
ULRICH: There are cracks\Nin the school building.
ULRICH: It may cave in.
ULRICH: XANA’s using some kind of\Nultrasound system.
JEREMIE: Ultrasound, huh? That’s possible.
JEREMIE: He could be using\Nthe electrical sockets.
ULRICH: Listen, he might attack the factory.
ULRICH: Odd’s on his way,\Nand I’ve warned Yumi.
JEREMIE: Let’s hope XANA gives me\Nenough time to repair my program.
ULRICH: Yes, Odd.
ULRICH: Huh?
ODD: I’m stuck, right.
ODD: With Milly and Tamiya\Nif you must know.
ODD: The firefighters will be here any minute,\Nso I can’t meet you right now.
ODD: No, don’t wait. Go to Lyoko.
KIWI: (BARKING)
ODD: No!
ULRICH: Odd! Odd!
ULRICH: No time to lose, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: But I’m not finished\Nfixing the program!
ULRICH: Odd is in danger.\NTransfer me right now.
SFX: (BARKING)
YUMI: What’s going on?
JEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Scanner Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
AELITA: Ulrich…
ULRICH: Aelita.
AELITA: Shh. They’re here.
JEREMIE: There’s nothing on my\Nholomap for now.
ULRICH: Things seem pretty calm.
AELITA: That’s not what the pulsations say.
ULRICH: If we follow them, they’re bound to\Nlead us to the tower XANA’s activated.
AELITA: Mhmm.
YUMI: What happened here?
SISSI: Odd…
SISSI: He’s stuck inside.
SISSI: With Milly and Tamiya.
MILLY: Oh, why aren’t they here yet!
ODD: Look, we can’t stay here.
ODD: We’ve got to cross over\Nto the other side!
TAMIYA: Are you out of your mind, Odd?\NIt’s at least a 10-meter drop!
ODD: Trust me, okay?
ODD: I can’t tell you how yet,\Nbut we’re gonna make it.
ODD: In the meantime, we’ve got to\Nget across where we’ll be safe.
TAMIYA: No!
ODD: No problem!
ODD: Your turn now!
ULRICH: We’re coming to the parallel pass.
ULRICH: Aah!
ULRICH: Jeremie, how many\Nlife points do I have?
JEREMIE: Hold on! 70! Uh, no. 60!
ULRICH: Make up your mind, Jeremie!\NI gotta know! Take cover, Aelita!
JEREMIE: I can’t do a million things at once!
JEREMIE: Dodge the lasers,\Nand you won’t have to keep count!
JEREMIE: Yumi, immediate departure.
JEREMIE: Ulrich and Aelita need your help!
JEREMIE: Okay, here we go.
JEREMIE: Transfer Yumi.
JEREMIE: Scanner Yumi.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
ULRICH: The pulsations are separating\Nin two directions now!
JEREMIE: Then head east.
JEREMIE: The monsters you managed\Nto dodge before aren’t very far away.
AELITA: Okay, Jeremie.\NWe’ll try to find another path.
ULRICH: Too late.
ULRICH: Yumi!
YUMI: Need a hand around here?
: Hiyah!
ULRICH: Impact!
YUMI: Here we go!
ULRICH: There!
ODD: There you go.\NOkay, your turn, Milly!
MILLY: No, I’ll never make it!
ODD: Sure you will! Come on!
MILLY: A-a-a-a-h!
ODD: Good going, girls.\NOkay, let’s get out of here.
ODD: I don’t believe it!
YUMI: Watch out!
ULRICH: Yah! Impact!
ULRICH: Y-a-a-a-h!
ULRICH: XANA’s pulled out all the stops.\NWe’re not gonna last long, Jeremie.
ULRICH: Jeremie, do you read me?
ULRICH: Jeremie!
JEREMIE: A little patience, guys!\NI’m almost done!
JEREMIE: Okay, Aelita can\Nenter the program now.
JEREMIE: It’s safe!
JEREMIE: We’re all set.
JEREMIE: Hang on, Aelita.
JEREMIE: I’m starting up the repair program.
YUMI: Just in time, too.\NIt’s getting kinda hot around here.
JEREMIE: Here we go!
JEREMIE: No! This can’t be!
AELITA: Jeremie, I’ve got to deactivate the tower.
JEREMIE: No! Give me a little more time!
JEREMIE: I’ll start over again!
AELITA: Jeremie…
AELITA: You know there’s no choice.
JEREMIE: You’ll be reformatted\Nand disappear, Aelita!
JEREMIE: I can’t let you do that!
AELITA: Are you ready for one last run?
JEREMIE: No, Aelita!
JEREMIE: Don’t do it!
ULRICH: I’ll be in front.
ULRICH: Impact!
YUMI: Hiyah!
JEREMIE: No! Don’t do it, Aelita!
AELITA: Goodbye, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: No!
JEREMIE: Aelita!
JEREMIE: Return to the past…now.
ULRICH: Jeremie, it wasn’t your fault.
JEREMIE: It was. And all that…
JEREMIE: for a strand of hair.
YUMI: Hey, the hair!
YUMI: Jeremie, didn’t you say that the hair\Ncontained Aelita’s entire genetic code?
JEREMIE: Her computer code, yes, but…
YUMI: Is it possible to reverse things,
YUMI: and recreate Aelita’s code\Nfrom the strand of her hair?
JEREMIE: Here we go.
JEREMIE: It works! The codes are getting restored!
JEREMIE: Let’s hope that…
AELITA: Jeremie!
AELITA: I’m ready for my materialization now!
ULRICH: Aelita!
YUMI: Aelita! It worked!
ODD: Yeah!
AELITA: Jeremie, did I miss something?
AELITA: Why is there water on your face?
JEREMIE: I’ll tell you later, Aelita.
JEREMIE: This time, we only missed…
JEREMIE: by a hair!
