ODD: so why not listen to what I\Ndownloaded from the web?
ODD: Go on, listen to it!\NIt sure beats studying!
ODD: It’s the cool music!

JEREMIE: Hey, you’re not gonna tell anybody, huh?
ULRICH: Promise, Romeo.
JEREMIE: Let’s get some breakfast.
ULRICH: Okay, but not with Odd.
ULRICH: He made me so mad last night.
JEREMIE: Whatever you say.
MILLY: Have you finished the layout?
TAMIYA: Yeah, sure.
JEREMIE: How come Odd’s still not here?
ULRICH: I couldn’t care less.
NICHOLAS: What’s the song’s name?
SISSI: The title is “Glad When You’re Bad.”
SISSI: I honestly can’t believe\Nhow unhip you guys are!
SISSI: You’re a couple of real losers.\NYou oughta go out once in a while!
NICHOLAS: Well then fill us in, Sissi.\NWhat kind of music is it? Is it R&B?
SISSI: R&B? Why not waltz music\Nwhile you’re at it…
JEREMIE: Odd ought to be here.\NMaybe he didn’t wake up.
ULRICH: Forget about it. It’s his problem.
JEREMIE: Hey, chill out, you’re\Nmaking such a big deal
JER: over a little bit\Nof loud music, Ulrich.
JEREMIE: We can’t let him miss his exam.
ULRICH: Yes, we can.
DEFAULT: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
YUMI: Hi.
YUMI: Odd isn’t here?
JEREMIE: No, and I’m beginning to worry.
YUMI: Did you check in his room?
JEREMIE: Not yet. We’re gonna do that right now.
: Right, Ulrich?
ULRICH: No, we’ll be late for the exam.
JEREMIE: Not if we hurry.
YUMI: Keep me posted, okay?
ULRICH: He sang that same\Ndumb song over and over.
ULRICH: And look. Now he’s fast asleep.
JEREMIE: Let’s wake him up.
JEREMIE: Hey Odd, get up, will you?
JEREMIE: Hey!
ULRICH: If this is a joke, it’s a bad one.\NAnd we’re gonna be late!

JEREMIE: Odd? Odd!
JEREMIE: This isn’t a joke!
YOLANDA: Odd? Odd? Can you hear me?
YOLANDA: Call the hospital!
YOLANDA: And tell them it’s very, very urgent.
MR. DELMAS: Hello? This is the\Njunior high school here.
MR. DELMAS: We need an ambulance immediately.
YOLANDA: His blood pressure\Nand his heartbeat are slow.
YOLANDA: I don’t understand.
MRS. HERTZ: If we add up the resistances\Nin a continuous circuit,
MRS. HERTZ: the intensity of the current diminishes.\NIn a derivative circuit, however,
MRS. HERTZ: the current produced by the generator\Nis equal to the sum of the intensities
MRS. HERTZ: in the derivative circuit branches.
YUMI: Odd?
YUMI: Sorry, Miss Hertz, it’s…\Nit’s Odd, he--
MRS. HERTZ: Yumi!
MRS. HERTZ: All right, settle down.
YUMI: What’s the matter with him?\NIs it serious? Well, is it?
JEREMIE: His heart’s beating very slowly.
YUMI: XANA!
JEREMIE: XANA’s not capable of\Nattacking human beings directly.
ULRICH: If only I’d stayed with him last night,\Nthis wouldn’t have happened.
ULRICH: We had a big fight,\Nand I slept in Jeremie’s room.
YUMI: How could you have known that?
ULRICH: I’m staying with him!
MR. DELMAS: I’m sorry, Ulrich, but I can’t\Npermit you to leave the school grounds.
ULRICH: I’m staying with Odd.
MR. DELMAS: Ulrich, get away from that ambulance!
MR. DELMAS: That is not the right way to help him!
ULRICH: I don’t care.
ULRICH: I can’t let him be taken away like this.
MR. DELMAS: Alright, you can go.
JEREMIE: I want to go with him too!
YUMI: Are you crazy?
YUMI: What if XANA launches an attack?
JEREMIE: We’ll stay in contact.\NCall me if there’s the slightest problem.
DOCTOR: We can’t handle many more emergencies.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, stop. You’re not to blame.
ULRICH: No, it’s all my fault.
JEREMIE: No, it’s not.
JEREMIE: Even if you had been there,\Nyou couldn’t have changed anything.
JEREMIE: I’ll go get us a soda.\NIt’ll do us both good.
ULRICH: I’m gonna go see Odd.\NI’ll see you in his room.
NURSE: Doctor, two new cases have just arrived.
NURSE: 40 heartbeats a minute.\NCan you take them?
DOCTOR: Send them to the Johnson’s hospital.

JEREMIE: Aelita?
JEREMIE: Aelita?
AELITA: Jeremie, how’s everything going?
JEREMIE: Not good.
JEREMIE: Odd’s in a coma, it’s really weird.
JEREMIE: His heart has almost stopped beating.
AELITA: Oh, no!
JEREMIE: No one knows what to do,\Nand the weirdest thing of all
JEREMIE: is that Odd may not be\Nthe only one hit by the illness.
AELITA: Bizarre.
AELITA: Do you think XANA’s capable\Nof creating a disease?
JEREMIE: I can’t believe he was actually able\Nto attack humans directly.
AELITA: Looks like he might’ve found a way.
JEREMIE: Anyway, I’d better warn Ulrich and Yumi.
JEREMIE: Meanwhile, see if you feel any pulsations.
AELITA: Okay.
YUMI: Sissi? Are you okay?
YUMI: Sissi!
YUMI: Hey, Sissi!
YUMI: Oh, no!
JEREMIE: Ulrich, I just spoke to Aelita.
JEREMIE: She’s gonna try and see if XANA\Nis the cause of our problem.
JEREMIE: If he did this, I can’t figure out how.
JEREMIE: What I do know is that going to Lyoko\Nis the only way to save him, so let’s go.
ULRICH: We’ll get you out of this.
ULRICH: I swear we will.
AELITA: Oh, no. XANA’s activated a tower.
YUMI: Hey, Jeremie, how’s Odd?
JEREMIE: His heart’s getting weaker and weaker!
YUMI: Sissi’s got the same symptoms.\NIt’s spreading!
JEREMIE: And it could be an epidemic\Nstarted by XANA!
YUMI: Did you reach Aelita?
JEREMIE: Yeah, I did. Get over to the factory, fast!

AELITA: Okay, I’ll wait here.
JEREMIE: Yumi!
YUMI: Jeremie, it’s the song that’s causing it!
JEREMIE: What do you mean, the song?\NI don’t understand.
YUMI: It is! It’s the song “Glad When You’re Bad!”
ULRICH: Oh, no!
ULRICH: I think that’s the song Odd\Ndownloaded from the web yesterday!
JEREMIE: XANA’s using the media\Nfor maximum coverage.
YUMI: He’s formatted the song, and now,\Nhe’s spreading it all over!
JEREMIE: A deadly melody.
ULRICH: Considering what it’s done to Odd,\Nwe better deactivate the tower.

BILL: The victims seem to be\Nunder the spell of the disease
BILL: whose origins are unknown,\Nand whose outcome could be fatal.
JEREMIE: That’s what you think.
BILL: Public health officials\Nare presently on the scene.
YUMI: Hiyah!

AELITA: Ulrich!
JEREMIE: Ulrich, you’re out of bounds\Nfor three minutes.
