AELITA: Tell me what the good news is, I can’t wait.
JEREMIE: We’re waiting for you here.
JIM: I don’t know what those kids are hiding, sir,\Nbut I intend to find out!
JEREMIE: Me and my friends, we do have a secret.
MR. DELMAS: Your paranoia is beginning to get on my nerves.
MR. DELMAS: I’m sorry Jim, but I’m going to have to let you go.
JEREMIE: Look Jim, if you help me, I’ll tell the principal everything.
JIM: Shake on it.
AELITA: I’m ready for the big jump, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Okay, Aelita, I’m launching the program\Nfor your materialization.
JEREMIE: Code Earth.
MR. FUMET: Come on, let’s go.
JEREMIE: Hey, relax Aelita, don’t worry, it’s just a history class.
AELITA: I’d feel a lot better if it were in computers.\NI don’t know anything about history.
ULRICH: That’s just it, you’re here to learn.\NIf it were a computer class, you could be the teacher.
MR. FUMET: Take your seats so we can begin.
SISSI: Just who does that new girl think she is?
SISSI: All she cares about is having boys around her.
NICHOLAS: Actually, I think she looks worried.
SISSI: Obviously Nicholas, you don’t know\Nthe first thing about girls.
SISSI: Acting frail and helpless will work every time.\NBoys love that, it’s the best way to attract them.
NICHOLAS: Hm?
MR. FUMET: We have a new student in our class. I’ll let her introduce herself.
SISSI: Hm.
AELITA: (STUTTERING)
ODD: Aelita’s her name. And she’s my cousin.\NShe’s very shy.
MR. FUMET: Hm, well Aelita, let me welcome you to Kadic Junior High.\NWe all hope that you’re going to like it here very much.
JEREMIE: You see, everything’s cool. There was no reason to worry.
AELITA: I guess not. And besides, I really like history.
AELITA: But you’ve got to admit, you fight a lot here,\Nthere are wars all the time.
YUMI: Hey guys! Well how’s our new Earthling doing?
AELITA: Oh, I’m fine.\NI’m trying to adapt to so many new sensations.
AELITA: Like the air that you breath here,\Nall the colors and the smells. But I’m fine.
JEREMIE: It’s about time we deactivated the supercomputer,\Ndon’t you think?
ULRICH: Well I wouldn’t wait for Xana to send us an invitation.
ODD: And who feels like going back to Lyoko\Nnow that Aelita’s here with us?
AELITA: You’ll think this is silly, but it scares me a little.\NLyoko after all, was my home.
AELITA: And I’m not really sure what effect\Ndestroying it might have for me.
JEREMIE: There’s nothing to worry about, I’m sure.
JEREMIE: Come on.
ULRICH: Hi, Jim!
ULRICH: Well did you have a good sleep?
JIM: Oh yeah, great.\NAnd I really appreciate everything you’ve done for me.
JIM: But I was getting a little bored, I have to admit.
ODD: How’d you like to watch us deactivate Xana?
JIM: I wouldn’t miss that for the world!
JIM: You haven’t forgotten your promise, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: I haven’t, Jim.
JEREMIE: As soon as Xana’s deactivated, I’ll tell the whole story\Nto the principal and you’ll get your job back!
JIM: That’s great.
JIM: I can’t wait ‘till all this is settled.
JIM: I honestly never imagined that I would\Nmiss being your PE teacher so much.
JIM: Uh, from now on, call me Jimbo, huh?
JEREMIE: Thanks, so are you ready to go, Jimbo?
JEREMIE: Here we are.
JEREMIE: Are you okay, Aelita?
JEREMIE: If you want to wait a day or two…
AELITA: No, the sooner the better.
JEREMIE: Okay. I think you should have the honor.
AELITA: No, I… I’d rather you did it.
JEREMIE: Sure, Aelita.
JEREMIE: Xana, you gave us a lot of grief. But thanks to you,\Nwe met Aelita. So goodbye and good riddance.
YUMI: Aelita!\NPut the power back on, Aelita’s not well, hurry up!
JEREMIE: What’s wrong with her?
ODD: Let’s hope Xana doesn’t rear his ugly head.
JIM: Her pulse seems back to normal again.
AELITA: I don’t know… what happened?
JEREMIE: You fainted, Aelita. It’s a little bit like sleeping.\NA really deep sleep.
AELITA: Oh I liked the way it felt.
JIM: Maybe you did, but you passed out, and that’s not normal.
JEREMIE: I modified the scanners’ program while you slept.\NDo you mind if I examine you?
AELITA: Uh, no.
JEREMIE: Launching program.
JEREMIE: Data recovery.
JIM: Don’t tell me you really understand all that.
JEREMIE: It’s not very complicated.
JIM: Hm.
JEREMIE: We’re ready to begin the analysis.
JEREMIE: Uh, that’s fine, Aelita, you can come back now.
JEREMIE: Okay, let’s try to see what the trouble is.
JEREMIE: That’s just what I was afraid of.
AELITA: It looks like Xana infected me with a virus.
JIM: Hm.
JEREMIE: That’s it!
JIM: Huh?
JEREMIE: He must have done it during the transfer.
JIM: Hm.
JEREMIE: There was a sudden drop in the voltage for a very short time.
AELITA: I remember that.\NBecause I had a strange feeling at that moment.
AELITA: For a few seconds I felt Xana’s presence,\Nas if he was trying to hold me back.
JEREMIE: And that’s probably the reason why you fainted a while ago.
JEREMIE: Xana implanted a virus inside you because\Nhe wanted you to be linked to him. And if we kill Xana…
AELITA: Then I get destroyed as well.
JEREMIE: (SIGHS)
JIM: Is there anything we can do?
JEREMIE: Yeah, try to find an antivirus.\NBut it could take a long time.
JEREMIE: I’m starting up an analysis program.
JEREMIE: The computer will work autonomously on it\Nuntil tomorrow morning.
JEREMIE: I’ll take you back to Yumi’s. It’s kinda late.
AELITA: What a strange sensation.
JEREMIE: You shivered, that’s all.\NIt’s a reaction you get on account of the cold.
AELITA: I like the feeling of being a little chilly.\NAnd the sounds and the smells are all different at night.
JEREMIE: Yeah, it’s quiet and peaceful,\Nand the plants, they breath differently.
JEREMIE: Here, smell this.
AELITA: It’s wonderful to be alive!
AELITA: And it’s thanks to you that I’m here.
JEREMIE: (STAMMERING) Well, I didn’t do it alone.
AELITA: What’s that? A scanner?
JEREMIE: No, not exactly. Follow me!
DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)
JEREMIE: Well your castle awaits you, Princess.
AELITA: Thanks for walking me back.
AELITA: In spite of the virus,\NI still had the most wonderful night of my life. Good night.
AELITA: See you tomorrow!
JEREMIE: Aelita’s… wow!
JEREMIE: (WHISTLING)
ULRICH: So do you have any idea how to get rid of\Nthis miserable virus?
JEREMIE: No, not yet. I hope the calculations\Nmy computer made will help me.
ODD: Here come the girls.
ULRICH: Well how was your first night on earth?
AELITA: Sleeping is really wonderful!
YUMI: She would have slept all day\Nif I hadn’t shaken her a little.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)
ODD: You’re just like me, Aelita.\NAnd you’ll see, sleeping in class isn’t too bad either.
JIM: (SNORING)
JIM: Huh? What’s going on?
DR. DEL CRE: Who can give us the definition of a pair of prime numbers?\NHm, Sissi?
SISSI: (STAMMERING) Well, uh, a pair of prime numbers is uh…\Ntwo numbers that are both the same.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)
DR. DEL CRE: Thank you, Sissi. Well, can one of you\Ngive us a less hare-brained answer? Aelita?
AELITA: A pair of prime numbers occurs\Nwhen their highest common denominator is one.
DR. DEL CRE: Very good, although-
AELITA: In a principal ring, it’s equivalent to the fact\Nthat their direct sum is equal to one
AELITA: but of course with a non-principal factorial ring,\Nthat is not the case.
AELITA: That is, according to the theory of Bézout, you see...
DR. DEL CRE: Bézout?
DEFAULT: (SCREAMING)
DR. DEL CRE: Calm down, children.
DEFAULT: (SCREAMING)
ULRICH: Get back!
ODD: Take cover!
JEREMIE: Xana’s changed tactics, he sent one of his monsters\Nto Earth for the first time! How did he manage that?
ODD: Who cares?\NThe problem is, how do you suggest getting rid of him?
ULRICH: Like we always do, we fight them!
ULRICH: You three head for Lyoko and deactivate the tower.\NYumi and I will stay here and defend the home front.
AELITA: Oh no, that’s crazy, Ulrich.
ULRICH: You know very well that if there’s a victim\Nthat going back in time won’t bring it back to life.
ULRICH: Yumi? Yeah, we already know. We’ve got to find weapons.\NOkay, I’ll meet you outside of the math class.
JEREMIE: Well, let’s go, guys.
DEFAULT: (SCREAMING)
ULRICH: I’ll handle him. Get going!
ULRICH: Let’s see how good you are.
ULRICH: Ow!
ODD: A few more seconds, and the coast will be clear.
ULRICH: (PANTING)
YUMI: What would you do without me?
YUMI: Hurry up!
ULRICH: Come on!
ODD: Wow, Jim gave them a good run for their money.
ODD: Jim? Jim?
JEREMIE: That way.
ODD: Huh?
ULRICH: Looks like they got their sights set on us.
ULRICH: Hm… ah!
YUMI: Okay, let’s show ‘em what we can do.
ULRICH: Hey, over here!
DEFAULT: (SCREAMING)
JIM: (GRUNTING)
JIM: You miserable monster!
JIM: I’ll make you think twice before\Nyou leave your world again!
AELITA: Oh no!
ODD: Hang on, Jim!
JIM: I told you to call me Jimbo, remember?
AELITA: Jeremie, you have to transfer me to Lyoko.
JEREMIE: What?
JEREMIE: Have you forgotten Xana’s virus, Aelita?
JEREMIE: What if Xana stops you from deactivating the tower?\NOr from returning to Earth?
AELITA: That’s a risk we’ve got to take.\NThe priority is to stop Xana.
AELITA: You know as well as I do that we have no choice, Jeremie.\NThink of all the other monsters Xana could materialize.
JEREMIE: Okay, get into the scanner. I’ll send you to Lyoko.
JEREMIE: I’m deactivating the infected scanner.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Get ready, Odd.{\i0}
JIM: Nice going, kid.
JEREMIE: {\i1}I’ve located the activated tower.{\i0}
JEREMIE: {\i1}It’s in the glacier region,{\i0}\N{\i1}that’s where I’m sending you.{\i0}
JIM: By the way, where are Ulrich and Yumi?
ODD: At school, fighting monsters.
JIM: I’m off. I’ll be a lot more useful there.
ODD: Here, it’s like a swiss army knife.
JIM: See you later!
JEREMIE: Transfer, Odd.
JEREMIE: Transfer, Aelita.
JEREMIE: Scanner, Odd.
JEREMIE: Scanner, Aelita.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
AELITA: It’s strange being virtualized.
ODD: Yeah, but you get used to it.
AELITA: No air to breathe, no smells, no warmth, nothing.\NI miss the real world already.
ODD: Let’s go, Aelita.
YUMI: Ulrich, we’re never gonna make it!
JIM: Bonzai!
JIM: Take that, you cockroach!
JIM: Got one!
JIM: Say your prayers!
ULRICH: There’s something I gotta admit, Jim,\Nthis is the first time I’m glad you caught us by surprise.
JIM: My friends call me Jim...bo, got it?
JEREMIE: {\i1}Squadron approaching at nine o’clock.{\i0}
JEREMIE: Three hornets.
JEREMIE: Here they come now.
ODD: Watch out!
JEREMIE: {\i1}They’re coming back!{\i0}
ODD: Head for the tower, I’ll hold them off!
JEREME: {\i1}You’ve got forty life points left, Odd.{\i0}
ULRICH: {\i1}Jeremie.{\i0}
JEREMIE: What is it, Ulrich?
JEREMIE: Where are you?
JEREMIE: Odd and Aelita really need your help.
ULRICH: We haven’t finished the job here yet.
JEREMIE: Odd’s only got forty life points left.\NIf Aelita’s left all alone, she’s headed for disaster.
ULRICH: {\i1}Okay, we’ll hurry up.{\i0}
JIM: You two had better high-tail it to Lyoko.\NI can handle these bugs on my own.
JIM: Am I right to say that the sooner you deactivate the tower,\Nthe safer the world’s gonna be? Is that it?
DEFAULT: Mh hm.
JIM: Well then what are you waiting for?\NGo on now and get the job done.
JIM: It takes a lot more than a few ugly monsters\Nto beat your friend Jimbo!
ODD: Take that!
JEREMIE: {\i1}You’re losing too many life points, Odd!{\i0}
YUMI: (YELLING)
JEREMIE: You gotta hang in there.
YUMI: {\i1}Jeremie!{\i0}
JEREMIE: Yumi! It’s about time.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Odd’s only got twenty life points left.{\i0}
YUMI: We’re heading for the scanner.
YUMI: Don’t worry about Odd, he can hold on a while,\Ntwenty points is enough for him.
ODD: Laser arrow!
ODD: Come on, I’m waiting for you!
ODD: Oh, I don’t believe it!
ODD: I’m out of arrows.
ODD: Bye bye.
AELITA: There it is.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Watch out, Aelita!{\i0}
JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita!{\i0}
AELITA: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
JIM: So, still haven’t had enough, huh?
JIM: Hey, you creeps! Over here! I’m ready, come on!
JEREMIE: {\i1}Aelita’s taking cover in a cave back there.{\i0}
AELITA: Oh no!
ULRICH: You can do better than that!
YUMI: Sorry.
YUMI: That way!
ULRICH: Uh huh.
JEREMIE: {\i1}Now, Yumi!{\i0}
ULRICH: There, that’s more like it!
YUMI: It’s all in the wrist. I’m a great frisbee player.
AELITA: That was close!
URLICH: Come on, Aelita, you know\Nwe would never let you go it alone.
YUMI: Hey, we can’t let the school go it alone either.
ULRICH: Right.
JIM: Yeah, take that! And that!
JIM: Well don’t just stand there, go on, run!
JIM: Leave those kids alone!
JIM: Come on, you bed bugs, gimme all you got.\NGo on, huh? Is that all you got?
JIM: What are you waiting for?\NCome on, you think I’m all washed up?
JEREMIE: Return to the past, now.
JEREMIE: Aelita, we’re restarting the materialization program\Nimmediately.
JEREMIE: We’ve got to wipe out Xana\Nbefore he launches another attack.
AELITA: Jeremie, it’s impossible.\NThe virus is still in me, I can feel it.
JEREMIE: We’ve still got to try it.
JEREMIE: Maybe you can be treated here on Earth.
AELITA: No, Jeremie. You know that as well as I do.
AELITA: As long as this virus is inside of me, you can’t\Ndestroy Xana without destroying me at the same time.
YUMI: We could materialize you for an hour or two,\Nso you could pay us a little visit, huh?
AELITA: Why not?
AELITA: But the rest of the time, I’ll have to stay here on Lyoko\Nto fight Xana. Until the day you find an antivirus.
JEREMIE: Aelita. I, uh…
JIM: Hm.
YUMI: Jim. We forgot all about him.
JIM: So, you kids are at it again.
ODD: No Jim, we were studying.
JIM: Studying, my eye, I’ve had enough of your lies.
JIM: You’re gonna stay right here until you tell me everything.
MR. DELMAS: Jim? What is going on here?
JIM: Ah, you came by just the right time sir.
JIM: I was just about to find out exactly what\Nthese children were up to again.
MR. DELMAS: Oh, another one of your absurd stories\Nabout mysterious meetings and secret passages, eh?
MR. DELMAS: I’ve had about enough of this, Jim,\Nand I’m going to have to-
ULRICH: He’s right sir, we really were plotting.
JEREMIE: We were. We were going to play a little joke on\NNicholas and Herb.
MR. DELMAS: Hm.
YUMI: In fact, sir, if Jim hadn’t caught us,\Nwe would have been late for school for sure.
MR. DELMAS: Well then, I’ll look the other way this time\Nsince you admitted what you’ve done.
MR. DELMAS: Now, off to class, children. Go on, now!
JIM: Well you made up one heck of a story, kids.\NWhy did you get me off the hook?
JEREMIE: Well it’s just that you never know,\Nmaybe one day you’ll do the same for us.
ULRICH: And you know, we never get the time to thank you\Nfor all you’ve done for us. So thanks a lot, Jimbo.
ODD: Yeah, thanks!
YUMI: You’re a hero. And a fantastic PE teacher, Jimbo!
JIM: Oh, well uh, you oughta tell the principal that!\NOkay now, go to class!
JIM: Huh, a hero… Wow.
