JEREMIE: Aelita, do you read me?
AELITA: Yes, Jeremie. Hi!
AELITA: All alone?\NWhere are the others?
JEREMIE: They’re out playing soccer.
JEREMIE: But I was feeling tired.
AELITA: Tired? That’s interesting.
AELITA: Jeremie, how do humans\N know when they feel tired?
JEREMIE: Well, you feel like\Nyou don’t have any energy.
JEREMIE: Like having weak batteries,\Nand so we rest a while.
AELITA: And is resting\Nsomething you like doing?
JEREMIE: I used to find it really boring,\Nbut ever since I met you, Aelita,
JEREMIE: it’s such a pleasure\Nhanging out together.
AELITA: It is for me, too, Jeremie.
ODD: Hey, Ulrich, pass it over here!
HERB: You won’t get by me!

ULRICH: Hi, Theo. Welcome.
ODD: Do you play?
THEO: Sure do! Let’s go!
THEO: Which team should I play with?
NICHOLAS: We don’t need you, okay?
THEO: I thought you were down seven to one.
THEO: What do you think, Sissi?
SISSI: Why not? Yeah, okay!
SISSI: It sure can’t get any worse!
AELITA: Alright, Jeremie. I’m here.
JEREMIE: Okay, we’re looking for the tower
JEREMIE: where part of the\Nscanner programs are stored.
JEREMIE: It’s at 30 degrees north, Aelita.
AELITA: I’m on my way.
JEREMIE: As soon as you’re connected,\NI’ll download the data that you find.
JEREMIE: It’ll help me understand\Nmaterialization better.
ULRICH: Okay, guys.
ULRICH: We’ve gotta stop, it’s time for dinner.
THEO: Nine-seven! We beat ’em!\NWhat do you think, princess?
ODD: Theo saved you guys\Nfrom humiliation!
HERB: Who cares about soccer?\N It’s a dumb game!
ODD: If you ask me,\NHerb’s got it in for Theo.
DEFAULT: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
ODD: Great, peas and carrots\Nfor the umpteenth time.
HERB: Sissi…
THEO: Ha-ha-hah! Hey!

THEO: Thanks a lot,\Nbut I can’t abandon my team!
THEO: You mind?

HERB: You’re not in our group,\Nso go take a hike!
THEO: Well, yeah. I know, Herb,\N but I’d love to join your group,
THEO: or should I say Sissi’s group?
THEO: Is that it?
THEO: Uh, what do I have to do?
HERB: Well, you’ve gotta pass our Initiation tests\Nand they’re really dangerous and hard!
HERB: Much too hard for you!
THEO: Initiation tests?
THEO: Tell me a little about them!
HERB: Test number one! Uh, you have to…\Nclean all the toilets with a toothbrush!
THEO: That sounds like a pretty dumb test.
THEO: That’s like the kind they give to\N 10-year-olds at summer camp,
THEO: so I’ll pass on that one.
HERB: Okay! Since you refused\N to pass our test, ciao!
SISSI: Hey!
SISSI: Since when do you\Ndecide on the tests?
SISSI: I’ll tell you what you have to do.
SISSI: You’re gonna mummify the skeleton\N we use in the science room.
THEO: Okay, now that sounds cool!
NICHOLAS: (CHUCKLES)
AELITA: Jeremie, did you manage\Nto gather all the data?
JEREMIE: I did, but it won’t do any good.
JEREMIE: Not unless I can pirate the access\Ncodes for the scanner programs.
AELITA: But that’s almost impossible!
JEREMIE: No, Aelita, I think It can be done.
ULRICH: Okay, they’ve left their rooms!
ODD: We’ll tell you all about\Noperation Theo later!
ULRICH: Here I go!
THEO: Still a long way to go…
HERB: (LAUGHS)
NICHOLAS: What are you gonna do, Herb?
HERB: I’m gonna warn our old friend, Jim!
HERB: They’ll kick Theo out of school,\Nand we’ll be home free!
DEFAULT: (HOWLING)
HERB: Huh?
NICHOLAS: What was that weird sound?
DEFAULT: (HOWLING)
KIWI: (HOWLING)
DEFAULT: Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
DEFAULT: (LAUGHING)
ULRICH: Nice work, little ghost!
THEO: What are you two guys doing here?
ODD: It’s okay. We were gonna tell you.
YUMI: Hey, things look serious\N between Sissi and Theo.
ODD: Yeah, they sure do.
ULRICH: You finished lunch already?
JEREMIE: No, but I wanna see Aelita\N for a while before class.
YUMI: I wouldn’t mind either.\N We’ll go together, okay?
ODD: Leave your trays!
ODD: It’s a shame to let\Ngood desserts go to waste.
JEREMIE: Odd, don’t you ever stop eating, huh?
ODD: Mmm!
ULRICH: Odd, you’re gonna explode\Nif you keep this up.
ODD: Nah.
ODD: Aah!
ULRICH: Hey!
YUMI: Which region are you in now?
AELITA: I was just in the forest,
AELITA: and I thought I sensed\Nsome pulsations, but I’m not sure.
ODD: XANA?
ULRICH: I’ll call Jeremie.
DEFAULT: (RINGS)
ULRICH: Jeremie, weird things are\Nhappening in the lunchroom.
ULRICH: Could be XANA’s doing.
JEREMIE: Why?
JEREMIE: What’s the problem?
ULRICH: There are short circuits everywhere.
JEREMIE: Aelita, could you\Ncheck things out on Lyoko?
AELITA: I will.
JEREMIE: I’ll launch a scan to see\Nif  XANA has activated a tower.
ODD: Let’s get out of here.
ODD: Aaaaah!
ULRICH: Hey, Odd!
ULRICH: Odd!
AELITA: Oh, no.
AELITA: I wasn’t mistaken.
JEREMIE: Tower localized.
AELITA: Jeremie, there are very strong\N pulsations in the forest.
JEREMIE: Yeah, the scan confirms it.
JEREMIE: And Odd and Ulrich\Nare trapped in the cafeteria.
JEREMIE: Yumi, I’ll head for the factory.
JEREMIE: Warn the principal,\Nand then meet me over there.
DEFAULT: (KNOCKING)
MR. DELMAS: Come in.
YUMI: Uh, can I see you for a minute, sir?
YUMI: Please, it’s important.
ULRICH: Did you see that?
MRS. HERTZ: Jim! Are you okay?
MRS. HERTZ: Oh, Jim, say something!
MR. DELMAS: Are you alright?
MR. DELMAS: We’ve got to cut the current now!
SISSI: Hello, is that you, dad?
SISSI: We don’t know what happened!
ULRICH: Move!
SISSI: There’s electricity everywhere.
SISSI: We’re trying to\Nbreak a window to get out.
MILLY: I’ve got to get out!
JEREMIE: Ulrich, what’s going on?
ULRICH: We’re prisoners here \Nn the cafeteria, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: I’ll send Yumi to Lyoko.
ULRICH: We’ll do our best over here.
JEREMIE: Yumi, hurry up.\NWe don’t have a lot of time.
YUMI: I told the principal.\NI’m at the passage in the park now.
JIM: What is this?
JIM: I just cut all the power!
MRS. HERTZ: With no effect at all!
MR. DELMAS: The firemen are on the way.
JEREMIE: I have no idea what XANA\Nwants to do this time.
AELITA: What about in town?
AELITA: Have any of the\Nother buildings been hit?
JEREMIE: No, that’s why I’m worried.
THEO: We’ll get out of this.\NDon’t worry, Herb.
HERB: Lemme go, will ya?
TAMIYA: Everything will be okay.
SISSI: Help is on the way.
TAMIYA: There, you see?
ODD: We could try the roof.
THEO: It’s probably the same.
ODD: It’s worth trying.
ODD: Outta the way!
THEO: It’s like a prison.
JEREMIE: But how come XANA’s\Nset his sights on the cafeteria?
JEREMIE: It makes no sense at all.
JEREMIE: He can’t gain access to the city\Nthrough the school.
ULRICH: He probably has other ideas.
JEREMIE: Wait, I think I understand!
JEREMIE: It’s the four of us he’s after!
ULRICH: Us? You sure?
JEREMIE: Yumi and I left lunch before dessert.\NIf not, we’d have all been there.
JEREMIE: He wanted to catch us all together!
ULRICH: XANA hasn’t missed a trick this time.\NWe’re never gonna get out of here.
JEREMIE: You’ve got to play for time.
JEREMIE: Yumi’s alone, she’s gonna need every\Nsecond she can to protect Aelita.
ULRICH: We’ll do the best we can.
AELITA: Jeremie, the pulsations\Nare really intense here.
AELITA: The tower can’t be too far.
JEREMIE: Stay where you are.
JEREMIE: I programmed the position.
JEREMIE: Yumi’s on her way.
JEREMIE: Transfer Yumi.
JEREMIE: Scanner Yumi.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
AELITA: The pulsations radiate\N in two directions.
YUMI: Jeremie, any news?
JEREMIE: Give me a little time\Nto analyze the terrain.
JEREMIE: I’m getting contradictory signals.
JEREMIE: Impossible to tell\Nwhich path is the right one!
YUMI: Well, we have no choice.
YUMI: Each of us will explore one path.
YUMI: We’ll stay in contact via Jeremie.
YUMI: Let’s go!
TAMIYA: You see?
TAMIYA: This way, even if the\N walls cave in, we’ll be safe.
TAMIYA: The roof won’t fall on top of us.
THEO: Watch out!
MR. DELMAS: Sissi! What’s going on?
MR. DELMAS: Answer me, child! Sissi!
YUMI: Jeremie, how are\Nthings going with Aelita?
JEREMIE: Nothing to report for now,\N and no monster in sight.
JEREMIE: That’s really strange, it’s too easy!
AELITA: Should I go on?
JEREMIE: I’ll call you back in 30 seconds.
JEREMIE: A quick analysis of the surroundings…
HERB: I gotta get out!
HERB: I gotta get out!
THEO: Wait! No, don’t, Herb!\NThe electricity! It’s live!
HERB: Leave me alone!
SISSI: Take it easy, Herb. Calm down!
SISSI: You’ve got to.
SISSI: You understand, hm?
YUMI: I’m stuck.
YUMI: This tunnel has got to lead somewhere.
JEREMIE: It’s got to lead to the path\Nthat Aelita took.
YUMI: Here I go.
AELITA: Jeremie…
JEREMIE: Hold on, Aelita.
JEREMIE: Aelita!
JEREMIE: Two monsters are on the way!
JEREMIE: You’re surrounded by two Krabs!
JEREMIE: Run!
AELITA: It’s impossible, Jeremie!
FIREMAN: I cut off all the wires, chief!
FIRE CHIEF: I doubt that. Nothing’s changed.
SISSI: Have the firemen really\Ntried everything, Daddy?
MR. DELMAS: They’re going to keep trying, dear.
THEO: We’ll be okay, you’ll see.
ULRICH: Jeremie, have you got anything new?
JEREMIE: I’m trying, Ulrich.
YUMI: Aelita, can you hear me?
YUMI: Oh, no!
JEREMIE: Stay out of sight, Aelita!\NYumi’s almost there!
DEFAULT: (CELESTIAL HUMMING)
AELITA: Yumi will get here in time.\NI know she will.
AELITA: I have faith in you, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Oh, no!
AELITA: I have faith in you.
YUMI: That’s what I call\Ngetting carried away.
AELITA: (CHUCKLES)
MR. DELMAS: Sissi, darling,\Nyou mustn't give up hope.
MR. DELMAS: The firemen are going to\Nmake an opening in the roof.
YUMI: There’s gotta be a passage\Nleading to the path that goes to the towers!
AELITA: There.
ODD: It’s all over now!
HERB: Thanks for what you did before.
HERB: I was pretty awful to you.
ULRICH: Jeremie, this is urgent! Come on!
JEREMIE: They’re almost there!
JEREMIE: Watch it, a third Krab is on the way!
YUMI: There it is!
YUMI: No, leave him!
YUMI: Go on, now! Hurry!\NDon’t worry about me.
YUMI: Hiyah!
JEREMIE: Good shot, Yumi,\Nbut he’s only damaged.
JEREMIE: But you took 20 life points from him.
JEREMIE: One more shot, and he’ll be done for!
JEREMIE: Aelita’s entering the tower.
JEREMIE: Phew.
JEREMIE: Return to the past now!
ODD: Hey Ulrich, pass it over here!
HERB: You won’t get by me!
SISSI: Oh!
SISSI: I don’t believe it! Oh!
SISSI: Oh, no!
ODD: G-o-o-o-a-l! Ha-ha-ha!
SISSI: Unbelieveable!
SISSI: You losers!
YUMI: Okay, guys.
YUMI: I’ve got to head for home.
ULRICH: If you want,\NI’ll walk you back home--
THEO: No, I’ll go!
THEO: So long, Odd, and thanks!
THEO: So, uh, which way do we go, huh?
ODD: What’s wrong?
ODD: It’s a lot better than having to\Nget up tonight to scare Herb, right?
ODD: Don’t you think?\NWhat’s wrong! Come on, Ulrich!
ULRICH: You’re toast, dude.
ODD: You’re never satisfied.
ODD: You got a better idea?
ODD: No? Well, me neither!
