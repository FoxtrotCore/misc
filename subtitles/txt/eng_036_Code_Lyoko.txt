MRS. HERTZ: Ants are social insects\Nlike termites or like bees.
MRS. HERTZ: A single individual is incapable\Nof any personal initiative.
MRS. HERTZ: All of the decisions are made by the colony.
MRS. HERTZ: Ants receive a few simple orders such as
MRS. HERTZ: search for food, mark the\Npath leading to the food,
MRS. HERTZ: and follow a marked path.
MRS. HERTZ: As a result, we might have the impression
MRS. HERTZ: that each ant is rather clever
MRS. HERTZ: when in fact, this has more to do\Nwith a collective intelligence.
ODD: You mean that an army of Sissis\Ncould be intelligent?
ODD: I don’t believe it!
SISSI: Very funny. Shut up, bird brain!
MRS. HERTZ: Settle down, please.
MRS. HERTZ: As I was saying,
MRS. HERTZ: thanks to their numbers,\Nthey manage to accomplish
MRS. HERTZ: some fairly difficult tasks\Nsuch as finding food
MRS. HERTZ: or defending themselves against an attacker.
MRS. HERTZ: It would seems that ants\Neven wage full-scale wars
MRS. HERTZ: between different colonies.
ULRICH: What about killer ants?
ULRICH: Do they exist?
MRS. HERTZ: Well, yes.
MRS. HERTZ: Maybe in movies, Ulrich.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
MRS. HERTZ: But there are, in fact, army ants
MRS. HERTZ: that destroy everything in their path.
MRS. HERTZ: And it’s true that you’d\Nbest stay out of their way.
SISSI: And, uh, do any of those\Nfilthy bugs live around here?
MRS. HERTZ: No, fortunately.
MRS. HERTZ: The live in South America.
MRS. HERTZ: Down there, the phenomenon\Nis called marabounta.
SISSI: Phew!
SISSI: I’m glad I live in a country\Nwhere there’s no danger.

DEFAULT: (STUDENTS CHATTER)
ODD: Saturday’s my favorite day.
ODD: No school in the afternoon.
ULRICH: I like Sundays better.
ULRICH: No school at all.
AELITA: You seem worried, Jeremie.
AELITA: What’s on your mind?
JEREMIE: Franz Hopper’s notes, Aelita.
JEREMIE: Last night, I decoded\Na really interesting part
JEREMIE: on a multi-agent system.
JEREMIE: It’s a computer application that\Nfollows the principle of an ant hill.
JEREMIE: What happens is--
ODD: Oh, no.
ODD: Misses Hertz has already bored us\Nto tears with all that ant stuff.
ODD: Don’t you start now!
DEFAULT: (LAUGHS)
JEREMIE: Seriously.
JEREMIE: This time I might’ve found\Na way to weaken XANA.
JEREMIE: Let’s meet up at the factory after lunch.
JEREMIE: I’ll explain everything.
AELITA: Well, normally I’d love to,
AELITA: but I have to finish my Italian homework.
AELITA: See ya.
ODD: Uh, no--I have to practice\Nfor a skateboard competition.
JEREMIE: Yumi?
YUMI: Sorry, I’ve got swimming after school.
YUMI: Buh-bye.
JEREMIE: What about you, Ulrich?
JEREMIE: Are you doing anything later on?
ULRICH: Yeah. I’ve got to be somewhere.
JEREMIE: Oh, yeah? Where?
ULRICH: The swimming pool.
JEREMIE: Right. Well, since everyone else\Nhas better things to do…
JEREMIE: I’ll just deal with it myself.
JEREMIE: Okay. Here we go.
WILLIAM: What do you know.
WILLIAM: Isn’t that Ulrich Stern about to dive?
YUMI: Hm?
ULRICH: (SQUEALS)
ULRICH: Aah!
YUMI: Ulrich!
SISSI: Out of the way!
SISSI: Let me through!
JIM: Huh?
DEFAULT: Is he okay?
DEFAULT: Is he breathing?\NIs he hurt?
DEFAULT: I’ll call somebody!
DEFAULT: He looks like he’s--
DEFAULT: He needs mouth to mouth!
SISSI: Get out of the way!
DEFAULT: Is he breathing?
DEFAULT: I don’t know.
JIM: Let me through!
JIM: I’ve got a first aid certificate!
JIM: (CLEARS THROAT)
JIM: Hm.
JIM: There you go.
JIM: Good thing I was here, huh?
ULRICH: (COUGHS)
YUMI: Are you okay?
JEREMIE: Now for the moment of truth.
JEREMIE: Everything seems to be working.
JEREMIE: Transfer prototype.
JEREMIE: Scanner.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
JEREMIE: Come on.
JEREMIE: Yes!
JEREMIE: Franz Hopper, you’re a genius!
JEREMIE: And so am I!
JEREMIE: XANA and his monsters\Nbetter watch out now!
ODD: What’s the matter?
ULRICH: Nothing.
DEFAULT: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
ODD: Jeremie?
JEREMIE: I have something amazing\Nto show you guys!
JEREMIE: Can you meet me at the factory?
ODD: Okay. Soon as possible.
KIWI: (YAPS)
JEREMIE: Great.
JEREMIE: And don’t forget to\Ngo and pick up Aelita.
ODD: Okay.
ODD: Jeremie’s called a meeting at the factory.
ODD: You coming?
ULRICH: I’m not in the mood.
ULRICH: I’d rather be by myself.
ODD: Come on!
ODD: If you don’t come, he’ll get mad.
ULRICH: Leave me alone.
ODD: Okay.
ODD: Suit yourself.
ODD: Both of you can stay here.
ULRICH: Both of us?
ODD: Yeah.
ODD: You and your bad mood.
JEREMIE: Ah, there you are.
JEREMIE: But where’s Ulrich?
ODD: He’s sulking.
ODD: I don’t know what his problem is.
AELITA: What’s this program?
JEREMIE: It’s marabounta.
JEREMIE: My own creation.
ODD: And what does it do, exactly?
JEREMIE: It’s a multi-agent system
JEREMIE: that functions according to\Nthe same principle as an ant hill.
JEREMIE: But instead of ants,\Nwe have these little spheres
JEREMIE: whose mission is to search\Nand destroy XANA’s monsters.
ODD: I get it.
ODD: While the monsters are\Ngetting wiped out by your ants,
ODD: XANA leaves us alone on Lyoko, is that it?
JEREMIE: You guessed it!
ODD: Hey, that’s great!
AELITA: But what if there’s a real bug in the program?
JEREMIE: Impossible.
JEREMIE: Remember, Franz Hopper was a genius.
ODD: Yeah, that’s right.
ODD: What do you say we go\Nto Lyoko to check it out?
ODD: If this thing really works,\Nnothing can happen to us!
JEREMIE: You read my mind, Odd.
JEREMIE: Go to the scanner room.
JEREMIE: I’ll transfer you.
JEREMIE: If there’s the slightest problem, I’ll pull the plug.
JEREMIE: Promise.
JEREMIE: Transfer Aelita.
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE: Scanner Odd.
JEREMIE: Scanner Aelita.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
JEREMIE: You guys are south of the marabounta.
JEREMIE: Take the path to your right.
JEREMIE: Sorry, but you’ll have to\Ngo without vehicles.
JEREMIE: I don’t have enough machine\Nresources to bring them up.
JEREMIE: And watch out for the bad guys.
JEREMIE: XANA may have his\Nhands full, but you never know.
ODD: Roger, general.
JEREMIE: A krab at two o’clock!
JEREMIE: Follow it.
JEREMIE: It’s headed in the right direction.
WILLIAM: Have you been crazy\Nabout Ulrich for a long time?
SISSI: Have you been crazy\Nabout Yumi for a long time?
WILLIAM: Forever.
SISSI: (SCOFFS) You’ve only been\Nhere for a few months.
WILLIAM: Don’t you believe in\NDestiny with a capital “D?”
WILLIAM: Two people who have never met,\Nbut who are made for each other?
SISSI: No. I’m not really into fairy tales
SISSI: or cheap magazine-style romance stories.
SISSI: I’ve had a crush on Ulrich\Nsince elementary school.
SISSI: I want to go out with him.
SISSI: That’s all there is to it.
SISSI: If it weren’t for that stuck-up Yumi, I’d…
WILLIAM: If it wasn’t for that big-shot Ulrich, I’d…
DEFAULT: (BOTH CHUCKLE)
YUMI: Shall we go? I’m getting cold.
JEREMIE: Target dead ahead.
ODD: Jeremie, I’ve got it!
ODD: I can see the marabounta.
JEREMIE: Well, what’s it like?
ODD: Pretty…scary.
DEFAULT: (SCREECHING)
ODD: I never thought I’d ever say it, but…
ODD: I really feel sorry for XANA.
AELITA: I’ll uplink you a visual, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: It’s working even better\Nthan I thought it would.
ODD: If you want my opinion, Einstein,
ODD: you’ve invented yourself\Na nasty piece of work.
JEREMIE: (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)
AELITA: Jeremie, I’ve seen enough.
AELITA: I want to come in.
JEREMIE: Yeah. Okay, Aelita.
JEREMIE: I’ll bring you back.
JEREMIE: Head southwest.
JEREMIE: There’s a tower nearby.
ODD: Got it.
AELITA: Odd! Look!
JEREMIE: Odd, Aelita,
JEREMIE: what’s going on?
JEREMIE: Answer me!
ODD: Laser arrow!
JEREMIE: Odd, say something!
ODD: You marabounta seems\Nto have it in for us!
JEREMIE: This is no time for jokes.
JEREMIE: I programmed it to attack\NXANA’s monsters only!
ODD: Well, could you program\Nsome eyeglasses for it, then!
JEREMIE: This can’t be right.
JEREMIE: Did you do something special?
ODD: No, except for firing a few laser arrows.
JEREMIE: That wasn’t the smartest thing to do.
AELITA: Jeremie, Odd didn’t have a choice.
AELITA: The marabounta was coming after me.
JEREMIE: How can that be!
JEREMIE: Unless…
JEREMIE: Oh, Jeremie, you idiot.
JEREMIE: It’s my fault.
JEREMIE: It’s the virus implanted in Aelita.
JEREMIE: The marabounta thinks\Nshe’s one of XANA’s monsters.
ODD: Great. Nice work, frankenstein.
ODD: I thought we had nothing to worry about!
JEREMIE: I was wrong.
JEREMIE: Okay, head for the tower.
JEREMIE: I’ll kill the program.
JEREMIE: Oh, no.
JEREMIE: Oh, no.
JEREMIE: Oh, no!
ODD: Whenever you’re ready, Jeremie!
JEREMIE: I can’t deactivate the program!
JEREMIE: It seems that the marabounta doesn’t want to die.
JEREMIE: The marabounta’s become autonomous.
JEREMIE: It’ll submerge everything\Nand everyone in its path.
JEREMIE: I’ll brief Yumi and Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Come on, Ulrich. What are you doing?
JEREMIE: Will you pick up!
DEFAULT: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
JEREMIE: Wow, that guy can really pick\Nthe right day to sit and sulk.
DEFAULT: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
YUMI: Jeremie?
YUMI: Huh?
YUMI: What are you talking about?
YUMI: What do you mean, the chattanooga?
JEREMIE: Marabounta.
JEREMIE: I can’t explain now.
JEREMIE: Just get here ASAP.
JEREMIE: Odd and Aelita are in big trouble.
JEREMIE: Ulrich’s at school, but I can’t reach him.
JEREMIE: I don’t know what’s going on with him.
YUMI: I do.
YUMI: I’ll get him and we’ll be right over.
ODD: Hey, Jeremie,
ODD: I think we lost your monster,
ODD: but now we’re kinda lost ourselves.
JEREMIE: I, um…
JEREMIE: Sorry, guys.
JEREMIE: Take off in the direction due west.
JEREMIE: The marabounta hasn’t hit that sector yet.
JEREMIE: In the meantime, I’ll find a way to stop it.
ODD: Don’t blow it, okay?
ODD: I don’t want to end up as chewing gum!
YUMI: (SIGHS)
YUMI: I was sure I’d find you here.
ULRICH: What I need is for everybody to leave me alone.
ULRICH: Especially you.
YUMI: Hey, if you want to make a\Nfool of yourself in front of everyone,
YUMI: don’t blame me.
YUMI: No one asked you to spy on me at the pool.
ULRICH: Spy on you? You’ve got to be kidding.
ULRICH: I just happened to be there, okay?
YUMI: Yeah, right.
YUMI: What an incredible coincidence.
YUMI: Anyway, do you mind\Nshelving your ego for a minute?
YUMI: Odd and Aelita need us on Lyoko.
ODD: Jeremie, bad news.
ODD: The marabounta got here first.
ODD: The tower’s unreachable.
JEREMIE: This won’t take me long.
JEREMIE: I’ll find a way to stop it. I promise.
JEREMIE: And Ulrich and Yumi are on the way.
JEREMIE: At least…I hope they are.
DEFAULT: (ERROR TONE)
JEREMIE: No, it can’t be!
JEREMIE: Hopper, help me out a little!
JEREMIE: If this goes on any longer,\Nall of Lyoko will be destroyed.
JEREMIE: Careful!
JEREMIE: XANA’s sending a monster!
ODD: That’s crazy!
ODD: That krab just sacrificed itself for you!
ODD: I don't get it.
JEREMIE: That’s weird.
JEREMIE: I-I think I understand!
JEREMIE: XANA knows he can’t let Aelita die.
JEREMIE: He needs her memory!
ODD: Hey, what’s the matter with them?
AELITA: They're…protecting me.
JEREMIE: Aelita’s right.
JEREMIE: Use them as allies to defeat the marabounta.
JEREMIE: At last! But where’s Ulrich?
YUMI: Alone with his pride.
YUMI: Want to tell me what’s going on?
JEREMIE: No time. Go straight there.
JEREMIE: Odd, Aelita, hang in there.
JEREMIE: The cavalry’s coming.
ODD: Laser arrow!
YUMI: Hiyah!
AELITA: No, Yumi! Not them.
AELITA: The marabounta’s the one to go after.
YUMI: Aah!
YUMI: What is that horrible thing?
ODD: One of Jeremie’s bright ideas.
ODD: Luckily, XANA’s here to give us a hand.
YUMI: The world has turned upside down!
DEFAULT: (KNOCKING)
ULRICH: Yeah?
WILLIAM: Hi.
WILLIAM: I came to see how you were.
ULRICH: Yeah, right.
ULRICH: When you have a good chance\Nto humiliate the competition,
ULRICH: you might as well go for it.
WILLIAM: Uh…did I miss something here?
WILLIAM: What’s your problem?
ULRICH: You’re my problem.
WILLIAM: Uh-uh. No, that’d be too easy, Ulrich.
WILLIAM: Let me tell you what’s wrong around here.
WILLIAM: My being around Yumi forces you\Nto ask yourself a question.
WILLIAM: A tough question that you can’t answer.
WILLIAM: Here’s a piece of friendly advice.
WILLIAM: Go and talk to Yumi. From the heart.
WILLIAM: Or else, one day, I will.
WILLIAM: And then I really will be your problem.
AELITA: How are you doing, Jeremie?
JEREMIE: I’ll never make it.
JEREMIE: I’m really the biggest loser ever\Nto walk the face of the earth.
AELITA: You couldn’t have known\Nthat my virus would be a problem.
JEREMIE: Your virus?
JEREMIE: Virus!
JEREMIE: What if…
JEREMIE: Yeah! Well…
JEREMIE: That ought to work!
YUMI: Hiyah!
ODD: Whatever you do, don’t\Nlet it make any headway.
ODD: It’ll attack from the rear.
YUMI: You’re a really good combat general, Odd.
ODD: It takes strategy, you know?
ODD: The only thing stupider\Nthan a blok is two bloks!
YUMI: Jeremie, move it!
YUMI: Things are getting a bit out of hand.
JEREMIE: Hey, I’m doing my best, guys.
JEREMIE: I think I found a way\Nto destroy the marabounta!
JEREMIE: Odd, I inserted a code for a\Ndeadly virus in one of your arrows
JEREMIE: If you hit a sphere with it,\Nthe whole colony will be infected.
JEREMIE: But…
ODD: No sweat!
JEREMIE: Wait!
JEREMIE: It’ll only work if you hit the first sphere.
JEREMIE: The one I transferred to Lyoko\Nthat created all the others.
JEREMIE: It’s at the heart of the marabounta.
ODD: Great.
ODD: So, how am I supposed to reach\Nthe heart of the marabounta?
ODD: On a camel’s back?
DEFAULT: (SNARLS)
JEREMIE: Odd, it’s the only way.
ODD: Charge!
ODD: Jeremie, would you mind telling me
ODD: how to find the right sphere in all this mess?
JEREMIE: I’ll guide you.
ODD: Whoa!
YUMI: Aelita!
YUMI: Hiyah!
AELITA: Yumi!
AELITA: Jeremie!
JEREMIE: You’re almost there, Odd.
JEREMIE: I’ll give you the exact\Nlocation of the first sphere.
ODD: It’s okay. I think I found it.
JEREMIE: You’ve only got one shot.
ODD: Yeah!
ODD: Ha ha!
AELITA: Look!
ULRICH: Don’t buy it, Aelita.
JEREMIE: Ulrich’s right.
JEREMIE: The marabounta’s gone,
JEREMIE: but XANA and his monsters\Nare still our worst enemy.
JEREMIE: He wants your memory at all costs.
ODD: Next time you want to play being a mad scientist,
ODD: clue us in a little more first, okay?
JEREMIE: Well, I really tried to,
JEREMIE: but you all had better things to do.
JEREMIE: But you’re right, Odd,
JEREMIE: because this time I was\Na big zero from start to finish.
AELITA: You found a way out of it,\NJeremie. That’s what counts.
SISSI: Well, if it isn’t the whole crew.
ODD: Well, if it isn’t the brainless frogface.
SISSI: Ha, ha, ha. You crack me up.
SISSI: Buy the way, Ulrich,
SISSI: Are you feeling better after\Nwhat happened at the pool.
ULRICH: Cool it, Sissi.
ODD: So, what happened at the pool, Ulrich?
ODD: Come on! Out with it!
YUMI: Nothing!
ULRICH: Nothing!
ODD: What?
