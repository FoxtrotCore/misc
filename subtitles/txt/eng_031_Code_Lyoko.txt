AELITA: (SCREAMS)
SISSI: Who is that screaming!
: (YELLS)
AELITA: Oh. W-Well, you are.
: (GRUMBLES)
SISSI: Do you know what time it is!
AELITA: Uh…5 o’clock in the morning?
SISSI: Y-Yes, that’s right!
SISSI: And this is the third night in a row\Nyou’ve woken me up!
SISSI: I have had it!
AELITA: (SCREAMS)
SISSI: Out of our way!
AELITA: Don’t go in there!
AELITA: There’s a huge wolf inside!
SISSI: Oh, really?
SISSI: Agh!
AELITA: Huh?
SISSI: A four-eyed wolf!

ODD: It’s a shame you didn’t\Ndream about me, Aelita.
ODD: Because, you know me,\NI’m a real dream come true.
ULRICH: More like a nightmare\Nto tell the truth, Odd.
YUMI: These visions of yours\Nare becoming a real problem.
JEREMIE: It all started at the Hermitage.\NI think you should go back there.
ODD: What? Back to that old house?
ODD: I’m not sure if you remember, but last time
ODD: we were attacked by a cupboard,\Na lamp, and a gang of forks!
AELITA: I don’t like that place. It scares me.
YUMI: We don’t have any choice, Aelita.
YUMI: If we don’t do something,\Nyour hallucinations could get worse.
JEREMIE: Don’t worry. This time\Nwe’ll be with you.
AELITA: My legs are shaking.
AELITA: What’s happening to me?
ODD: You’re scared. It’s nothing to worry about.
ODD: It happens to Jeremie all the time.
JEREMIE: Come on. We’ll see who’s scared!
ODD: There! There!
ODD: Stay down, boy!
JEREMIE: See? Everything is just fine.
DEFAULT: (HOWLS)
AELITA: (SCREAMS)
YUMI: Aelita! Are you okay?
AELIA: Yes. I mean, I think so.
JEREMIE: Did you have another vision?
AELITA: Yes, but it was different this time.
AELITA: It’s as if something, or someone,
: was leading me to…
AELITA: There was something\Nin a tree! Like that one!
AELITA: Huh?
AELITA: Mister Pϋck!
JEREMIE: So, to make a long story short,
JEREMIE: Aelita’s never seen this toy gnome,
JEREMIE: but she’s been dreaming about it for days
JEREMIE: and she knows it’s called Mister Pϋck.
ULRICH: It’s not a gnome. It’s an elf.
ODD: Well, whatever it is,
: this whole story is\Ndefinitely paranormal.
SISSI: Well, Aelita! Still playing with dolls?
JEREMIE: Sissi, give that back right now!
SISSI: Go fetch!
NICHOLAS: (CACKLES)
ULRICH: Hey!
ULRICH: A bit of advice -- give me\Nthat toy right now.
NICHOLAS: What toy? Heh!
ODD: Herb!
ODD: I dare you to take your\Nglasses off! Come on!
SISSI: I got it!
ULRICH: Uh-uh!
MRS. MEYER: What is all this noise about?
SISSI: Okay, you can have it.
SISSI: But only because it’s you.
MRS. MEYER: Right.
MRS. MEYER: Look at this triangle marked A, B, C.
MRS. MEYER: The point I is in the middle\Nof the segment AB…
JEREMIE: What’s this key doing here?
AELITA: What do you think it opens?
JEREMIE: I sure wish I knew, but\NI have no idea at all.
JEREMIE: Hey!
JEREMIE: A locker! It’s the key to\Na train station locker!
MRS. MEYER: Jeremie?
MRS. MEYER: I’m listening.
JEREMIE: Um…a complex number\Nis called transcendent
JEREMIE: only if the rational coefficient's\Npolynomial root is a polynomial zero.
MRS. MEYER: Yes, indeed. That is the\NSierpinski-Mazurkiewicz Paradox.
MRS. MEYER: But it is not the answer\Nto our problem, so zero.

DEFALUT: Train 6537 leaving\Non track 5. All aboard!
JEREMIE: This is it.
JEREMIE: Would you like to do the honors?
ULRICH: "F. H." What does that stand for?
ODD: Fuzzy hands? Fifty-cent hot dogs?
ODD: Fried hegg?
ULRICH: Egg doesn’t start with an H.
ODD: Just testing to see if\Nyou were on your toes!
ODD: Oh, wow! Music!
JEREMIE: Certainly not.
JEREMIE: Let’s see what we\Ncan come up with.
JEREMIE: Franz Hopper’s diary!
YUMI: Great!
YUMI: Maybe we'll be able\Nto find out more
YUMI: about the Hermitage’s\Nmysterious owner.
JEREMIE: For sure.
JEREMIE: But not right away --\Neverything is encrypted.
JEREMIE: I’ll have to decode it first.
ULRICH: How much time do you need?\NOne? Maybe two hours?
JEREMIE: More like one or two years.
: (RADIO PLAYS)
ULRICH: Come on. Time to get up.
ODD: Mhhn. Just a little bit longer!
ULRICH: I’m gonna take a shower.
DEFAULT: (UNNERVING MUSIC)
KIWI: (BARKS)
ODD: GAAAAH!
ODD: Ulrich, you here?
ULRICH: Ahhg!
ULRICH: (COUGHS)
ULRICH: Jeremie! Jeremie!
JEREMIE: Huh? What?
ODD: XANA's ghosts attacked us!\NMe and Ulrich.
JEREMIE: What?
ULRICH: Don’t worry. No harm done.\NThey ran away.
JEREMIE: The superscan didn’t detect\Nany activated towers.
JEREMIE: XANA’s attack failed.
JEREMIE: That’s weird. XANA can posses\Nhumans, but not you two.
ODD: It must have something\Nto do with sex appeal.
JEREMIE: Yeah, right. I’m sure of that.
ODD: See you later!
JEREMIE: Wha--gaaah!
JIM: Running is the noblest event in athletics.
JIM: Except maybe for the long jump.
JIM: Or the shot put, javelin,\Nhigh jump…pole vault.
JIM: Some of you may associate\Nrunning with cowardice.
JIM: As in running away.
JIM: Nothing could be\Nfurther from the truth
JIM: since he who runs well goes far!
JIM: (CHORTLES)
JIM: Jeremie!
JIM: Uh, let’s see how\Npowerful your strides are.
JIM: Hmph. For those of you\Nwith short memories,
JIM: Let remind you that, uh…
JIM: What was I gonna say?\NUh, right.
JIM: Uh, may I remind you\Nthat we start when I say go.
JIM: Not on "get set"\Nand not on "ready."
JIM: I mean, well, after "ready."\NGet set is when I say "go."
JIM: Right.
JIM: Okay.
JIM: On your marks.
JIM: Get set.
JIM: Go!
JEREMIE: Uhg! Ouch!
JIM: What now?
JEREMIE: I twisted my ankle!
JIM: Yeah, of course you did!
JIM: You don’t get strong muscles\Nsittin' in front of a computer!
JIM: Herb, take him to the infirmary.
JEREMIE: Jim…
JEREMIE: Would you mind if Aelita\Ncame with me instead?
JIM: Okay, whatever.
JIM: Go on, then.
JIM: Take him far away from me!
AELITA: Jeremie? You’re not limping anymore.
AELITA: Has your ankle stopped hurting?
AELITA: Aah!
JEREMIE: Gah!
DEFAULT: (CELL PHONE VIBRATES)
ULRICH: Yumi.
YUMI: Ulrich, I think Jeremie’s been\Npossessed by XANA!
ULRICH: Are you sure?\NThis morning, Odd and I
ULRICH: were almost possessed\Nby a couple of ghosts,
ULRICH: but they didn’t succeed.
ULRICH: Why would it work on Jeremie?
YUMI: No idea, but I saw him\Nheading for the park lands.
YUMI: Aelita’s in his arms.\NShe was unconscious.
ULRICH: Oh, no.
YUMI: I’ll check the superscan.
YUMI: Let’s meet at the factory.
ULRICH: Okay.
JIM: Pitiful!
JIM: A slug coulda made it around faster!
JIM: Ulrich, I’m counting\Non you to raise the level!
ULRICH: Uh, okay!
ULRICH: But I’ve gotta go to\Nthe restroom first.
ODD: Oh, and I gotta go too, Jim!
JIM: (SIGHS)
JIM: Okay, okay!
JIM: Make it snappy!
JIM: Right, which one of you wimps is next?
YUMI: Sector One. The ice territory.
YUMI: South-southeast.
YUMI: Huh?
ULRICH: Yeah.
YUMI: XANA's attacked!
YUMI: We have to stop Jeremie, and fast, too.
ULRICH: Okay. We’re on it!
AELITA: Jeremie!
AELITA: Jeremie, no! Listen to me, please!
ODD: So, you going down, too?
ODD: Boy, it’s totally weird to be\Nfighting against Jeremie.
ODD: I mean I don’t want\Nto hurt him, but…
ODD: (WHIMPERS)
ULRICH: Heah!
ULRICH: Yeagh!
ULRICH: Agh!
AELITA: (SCREAMS)
YUMI: Hiyah!
YUMI: Quick. We’ve gotta get to Lyoko.
YUMI: Here.
YUMI: These are the coordinates\Nof the activated tower.
ODD: You guys go ahead.\NI’ll take care of him!
ODD: (GROWLS)
ODD: Okay! Over here, twinkle fingers!
ODD: I have a good feeling\Nwe’re really gonna hit it off!
YUMI: How are you doing, Aelita?
YUMI: Think you can handle it?
AELITA: I’m not as good as Jeremie at it.
AELITA: The virtualization countdown\Nhas been launched.
AELITA: Look! There!
AELITA: He who runs well goes far!
YUMI: Is Odd the one who\Nteaches you nonsense like that?
AELITA: No. As a matter of fact, it’s Jim!
ODD: Whoa!
ODD: I’m sure glad that post was\Nthere and not my face.
ODD: Got any other tricks up your sleeve?
DEFAULT: (THUNK)
ODD: Uh-oh! That wasn’t\Nvery smart, was it?
ODD: Especially since you’re\Nthe one who’s gotta fix it.
ULRICH: Keep your eyes open, huh.
ULRICH: We don’t have Jeremie to\Nwarn us about monsters this time.
DEFAULT: (RUMBLING)
ULRICH: Uh-oh. I don’t like the sound of that.
ODD: How can you have\Na decent discussion
ODD: with someone who has\Nno sense of humor!
ODD: Oh, easy does it!
ODD: Hah ha! Not so clever now, huh?
YUMI: Bloks!
ODD: Take this!
ODD: Aaaah! G-g-g-g-gaaah! Whoa!
ULRICH: Aah!
ULRICH: Yumi, protect Aelita!
ULRICH: I’ll take care of the bloks!
YUMI: Right!
ULRICH: Triplicate!
ULRICH: Fusion!
ODD: Hey, sparky!
ODD: Scared of heights, huh?
ODD: O-Okay, so you’re not\Nscared of heights.
YUMI: Nice one, Aelita!
ULRICH: I’m gonna knock your block off,\Nyou dumb blockhead!
YUMI: Sounds like you miss Odd!
YUMI: Your jokes are worse than his!
YUMI: That’s what I call a job--
JEREMIE: Materialization Yumi.
AELITA: Yumi.
AELITA: Ulrich!
ULRICH: Hang on!
ULRICH: I’m coming!
ULRICH: Trangulate!
AELITA: The scyphozoa!
ULRICH: Aelita!
ODD: Uh-uh!
ODD: It’s not nice to devirtualize\Nyour best friends!
ULRICH: Super sprint!
AELITA: Thanks, Ulrich.
ULRICH: No sweat.
ULRICH: Head for the tower.\NI’ll take care of this overgrown bug.
ODD: Oh, never trust a guy with glasses.
AELITA: Tower deactivated.
YUMI: Well?
YUMI: How are you feeling?
JEREMIE: Ugh.
JEREMIE: Strange.
JEREMIE: I remember talking to Odd and Ulrich,
JEREMIE: and then after that, nothing.\NJust a black hole.
AELITA: XANA took control of you.
ULRICH: He destroyed all of Franz Hopper’s CD’s.
ULRICH: Apparently he had a problem with his notes.
JEREMIE: Whew.
ODD: What do you mean, “whew?” It’s a disaster!
JEREMIE: No, it isn’t.
JEREMIE: Last night, when I got back\Nfrom the train station,
JEREMIE: I stopped in here and I copied the CD’s
JEREMIE: onto a highly restricted access\Npart of the supercomputer.
JEREMIE: I'm the only one who can access them.
AELITA: You’re a genius, Jeremie!
ULRICH: Still, there’s something I don’t get.
ULRICH: Why couldn't XANA’s ghosts\Ntake control of Odd and me
ULRICH: and have no trouble controlling Jeremie?
JERMIE: No idea.
YUMI: I might have an explanation.
YUMI: Apart from you, we’re all\Nused to fighting on Lyoko.
YUMI: Maybe that gives us\Nmore resistance to XANA.
JEREMIE: Maybe.
JEREMIE: But then how can we protect me?
ODD: Hmn.
ODD: I just might have the answer.
DEFAULT: (SCANNER REVVING)
JEREMIE: Ugh.
ODD: Well?
JEREMIE: That’s the last time\NI ever set foot on Lyoko!
ULRICH: Why?
ULRICH: Just because of a couple of megatanks?
JEREMIE: It’s really just not my thing!
JEREMIE: I’ll never be able to hack it!
JEREMIE: You know, I think I’d rather\Nbe possessed by XANA
JEREMIE: than go back there.
JEREMIE: I’ll keep on the lookout for ghosts, that's all.
AELITA: Well?
AELITA: What did he look like on Lyoko?
ODD: He looked…how--\Nhow can I say this tactfully?
ULRICH: Ridiculous.
ODD: That’s the word.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
YOUNG AELITA: Come on, Mister Pϋck.
YOUNG AELITA: Let’s go for a walk in the garden.
