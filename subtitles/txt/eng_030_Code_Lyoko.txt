JEREMIE: What about the mantas?\NHow are we doing?
ULRICH: Looks like they're\Ngonna hatch real soon.
ODD: And judging by\Nthe size of the nest,
ODD: We're gonna have some\Nbig bouncing babies!
JEREMIE: Okay. That's it for now, Aelita.
AELITA: Just a little longer, Jeremie.
AELITA: We've never been able\Nto access this much data!
JEREMIE: Let me take over now, okay?
ODD: Aelita, listen, I don't want\Nto rush you, but uh…
YUMI: Jeremie, they're here.
JEREMIE: Okay. I've got things under control.
JEREMIE: Three vehicles coming right up!
ODD: Wow!
ODD: Still just babies and check 'em out!
ULRICH: What do you think they are?
ULRICH: Male or female?
ODD: Considering their tempers,\Nthey've got to be girls, right?
ULRICH: Just watch.
ULRICH: I'll show 'em what is it to be a guy.
YUMI: Jeremie, tell me, do I\Nreally need to hear this?
JEREMIE: Uh, sorry, Yumi, but you\Ncan't always choose your friends!
JEREMIE: Anyway, the tunnel will be open soon.
ODD: Just in time!
JEREMIE: Okay. The tunnels are open.
JEREMIE: The mantas shouldn't follow you inside.
JEREMIE: And there you go.
JEREMIE: The data analysis program is running.
ODD: Great!
ODD: And what does that mean exactly?
JEREMIE: With all the data that\Nwe've been able to recover,
JEREMIE: I've got a good chance of\Nfinding the antivirus.
ULRICH: You mean that pretty soon we'll be able
ULRICH: to shut down the super calculator?
JEREMIE: Exactly.
JEREMIE: And if it works,
JEREMIE: Aelita will no longer be tied \Nto XANA by that horrible virus.
ODD: Oh, shoot.
ODD: What are we gonna do\Nwith our free time?
ODD: I mean, if we can't\Nsave the world anymore…
YUMI: You might study a little more.
YUMI: And learn something for once.
JEREMIE: 3 AM? Wow.
JEREMIE: We'd better head for our rooms\Nif we don't want to get caught.
JEREMIE: Well, good night.
ODD: You mean what's left of it.
AELITA: Jeremie, do you really think
AELITA: that your calculations\Nwill lead to something?
JEREMIE: We can't be 100 percent\Nsure, but I think so.
AELITA: I can't believe that\Nsoon I'll be really real.
JEREMIE: Well, to me, you already are.
JEREMIE: Very real. I mean it.
JEREMIE: And to everyone else,\Nyou're Aelita Stones.
JEREMIE: Odd's cousin.
AELITA: You know very well that isn't true.
JEREMIE: But a lie that everyone believes\Nisn't really a lie anymore.
JEREMIE: Hey, don't worry, Aelita.
JEREMIE: Tomorrow's gonna be a great day.
JEREMIE: Believe me.
JEREMIE: Good night.
AELITA: Good night, Jeremie.
SISSI: This time, I've got 'em.
RADIO: It's Tuesday already!
RADIO: No, you're not dreaming!
RADIO: Or, rather, you're\Nnot dreaming anymore!
RADIO: It's already 7 o'clock in\Nthe morning on Sky Radio.
RADIO: Look out your window!
RADIO: The sun is shining,\Nthe birds are singing,
RADIO: and me, I'm talking,\Ntalking, talking!
RADIO: To keep you from\Nfalling back to sleep!
RADIO: You bunch of lazy bones!
RADIO: It's a great day that's\Ngonna start off great
RADIO: Thanks to Sky Radio
RADIO: with the Subsonics' latest hit!\NHere it comes--
MR. ISHIYAMA: Hmph. I can't help but wonder\Nwhat a girl your age
MR. ISHIYAMA: could possibly be doing out\Nat such a late hour.
MR. ISHIYAMA: There's a boy behind this, isn't there!
YUMI: I couldn't exactly tell them that\Nthere were three friends involved
YUMI: and all of them boys, could I?
YUMI: That would've really freaked them out.
ULRICH: Why don't you just make up a story?
ULRICH: I do it all the time with my parents.
YUMI: I'm sick of lying.
YUMI: I-I'd love to be able to\Ntell them everything.
YUMI: Like I used to.
JEREMIE: Don't worry, Yumi!
JEREMIE: Soon, you won't have to lie any more.
JEREMIE: Come on! Cheer up!
JEREMIE: It's gonna be a great day!
JEREMIE: They said so on the radio!
HERB: Don't you think Jeremie\Nlooks happy this morning?
SISSI: Not for long.
SISSI: Hey!
JEREMIE: Whoa!
SISSI: Jeremie, would you listen\Nto something for me?
SISSI: You'll see.\NThere's not a lot of music,
SISSI: But the words are really interesting.
JEREMIE: She taped the whole conversation.
ULRICH: But what does she want exactly?
JEREMIE: She wants to be a part of our group.
JEREMIE: And that we explain everything\Nto her from A to Z.
JEREMIE: If not, she'll tell her father everything.
ODD: She's even worse than I thought.
MRS. HERTZ: Excuse me, you three,
MRS. HERTZ: but do you mind if I teach a class here?
ODD: Not at all, mam.\NAfter all, it is your job.
MRS. HERTZ: Yes, and my job is also to\Nask questions, isn't it, Odd?
MRS. HERTZ: So, would you be\Nkind enough to tell me
: the mass and moles\Nof two oxygen atoms?
ODD: Um…um…
MRS. HERTZ: 32 grams per mole.
MRS. HERTZ: And the principle of photosynthesis?
ODD: Uh…you mean…
MRS. HERTZ: The synthesis of oxygen for plants
MRS. HERTZ: possessing chlorophyll placed in light.
MRS. HERTZ: Alright, here's an easy one now.
MRS. HERTZ: Which student in this graduating class
MRS. HERTZ: is the biggest failure in science
MRS. HERTZ: who nevertheless takes the liberty
MRS. HERTZ: of not listening to my lessons?
ODD: Um…me, Misses Hertz?
MRS. HERTZ: Bravo. Well done, Odd.
MRS. HERTZ: You see what you can do\Nwhen you apply yourself?
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
JEREMIE: Whatever happens, we can't\Nlet Sissi tell her father.
ULRICH: Don't worry, Jeremie.
ULRICH: I've got an idea.
SISSI: I'm so happy that\Nyou finally decided
SISSI: to give me a lesson\Nin Pen-sharve Key-lot.
ULRICH: Pencak Silat.
SISSI: Whatever. Well, I wonder\Nwhat could've made you
SISSI: change your mind all of a sudden!
ODD: Is it this one?
JEREMIE: Uh-huh.
JEREMIE: Huh?
HERB: Maybe this is what you're looking for.
ULRICH: This is a basic lanka.
ULRICH: You ought to be able to manage it.
ULRICH: (CHUCKLES)
ULRICH: Huh?
NICHOLAS: You were right, Sissi. As usual.
HERB: They were after the minidisc!
SISSI: Oh, wow! Gentlemen,
SISSI: did you think you were\Nsmarter than me?
SISSI: You don't know me very well.
SISSI: So, now it's time to spill the beans.
SISSI: Tell me everything you've been up to\Nfor long as I can remember!
SISSI: What's the big conspiracy!
SISSI: Oh, you won't tell me a thing? Is that it?
SISSI: Okay, then. You asked for it.
SISSI: I'm gonna play this recording\Nfor my father. Hmph.
RADIO: It's Tuesday already!
RADIO: No, you're not dreaming!
RADIO: Or, rather, you're\Nnot dreaming anymore!
RADIO: It's already 7 o'clock in\Nthe morning on Sky Radio.
RADIO: Look out your window!
RADIO: The sun is shining,\Nthe birds are singing…
RADIO: …Thanks to Sky Radio
RADIO: with the Subsonics' latest hit!\NHere it--
YUMI: Hi, dad.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Yumi, I have to talk to you.
YUMI: Papa, I know what\Nyou're gonna tell me.
YUMI:  You're totally right.
YUMI: Okay! I'm sorry!
MR. ISHIYAMA: Yumi!
JEREMIE: But I didn't program\Ngoing back in time.
AELITA: Then how do you explain the fact\Nthat Tuesday is starting again?
JEREMIE: It's weird.
JEREMIE: Let's go to over to the factory\Nafter science class to check it out.
ULRICH: At least we've got a second chance\Nto get Sissi off our backs.
ULRICH: Sissi? Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
SISSI: What? You are?\NB-But you see, I…
SISSI: I wanted to talk to Jeremie.
ULRICH: Aw, that can wait.
ULRICH: There's something I've been wanting\Nto ask you for a long time.
ULRICH: But I just can't\Nbring myself to do it.
SISSI: You…uh…y-you can't…
ULRICH: Would you like to learn\NPenchak Silat with me?
SISSI: Well, uh, yes!
MRS. HERTZ: So, would you be\Nkind enough to tell me
MRS. HERTZ: the mass and moles\Nof two oxygen atoms?
ODD: 32 grams per mole, mam.
MRS. HERTZ: Uh, oh. Yes, that's right.
MRS. HERTZ: Uh, very well, Odd. Now, please,
MRS. HERTZ: would you explain to me the\Nprinciple of photosynthesis?
ODD: Of course, mam.
ODD: That would be the synthesis of oxygen
ODD: from plants possessing\Nchlorophyll placed in light.
MRS. HERTZ: Odd, is it really you?
MRS. HERTZ: You haven't been replaced by a clone?
ODD: No, mam, why?
ODD: Is something wrong?
MRS. HERTZ: No…uh, no.
MRS. HERTZ: Let's go on with our lesson.
ODD: Wow. Hey, being a\Ngood student is so cool!
JEREMIE: (CHUCKLES) Yeah.
ULRICH: Very good. You learn really fast.
SISSI: You think so? That's great!
ULRICH: Uh, Sissi, could…could I\Ntalk to you as a friend?
SISSI: Sorry? As a what?
ULRICH: As a friend.
ULRICH: You see…I'm worried\Nabout Jeremie and Aelita.
ULRICH: I know you're gonna laugh, but…
SISSI: Laugh? But why?
ULRICH: Well, um…
ULRICH: You see, they've kind of lost it.
ULRICH: For some strange reason,\Nthey think they're virtual people.
SISSI: What's that?
AELITA: Do you think we're going\Nto live the same day
: over and over again?
JEREMIE: First, I have to isolate the\Nprogram that jumps back in time
JEREMIE: to see what's going on.
AELITA: Maybe it's XANA's doing.
JEREMIE: We'll know in a minute.
YUMI: Odd, you mind telling us\Nwhat you're doing over there?
ODD: I'm studying.
ODD: That's what you wanted\Nme to do, wasn't it?
JEREMIE: Look at that!
JEREMIE: XANA's managed to take control\Nover going back in time!
AELITA: But how?
JEREMIE: In my opinion, by using the data\Nwe recovered from sector five.
JEREMIE: Booby-trapped data!
AELITA: But why would he do that?
AELITA: He must have a good reason.
JEREMIE: I don't know.
JEREMIE: In any event,\Nit's starting up again.
JEREMIE: We're gonna go directly\Nback in time in a few minutes.
JEREMIE: I'm launching a scan to see\Nif a tower has been activated.
AELITA: I can't believe that\Nsoon I'll be really real.
ULRICH: It's even worse than I thought.
ULRICH: They've gone right off the deep end.
SISSI: But…that's crazy.
ULRICH: It's much worse.\NThey're totally out of it.
JEREMIE: Tower activated!\NXANA's launched an attack!
YUMI: But what kind?
JEREMIE: I don't know yet, but\Nwe can expect the worst.
JEREMIE: He didn't take control of\Njumping back in time for the fun of it.
JEREMIE: Get ready! It's starting again!
RADIO: It's Tues--
RADIO: …with the Subsonics' latest hit--
YUMI: Hi, dad!
MR. ISHIYAMA: Yumi!
ODD: What's fascinating is that\Nplants use the sun's energy
ODD: to change water and\Ncarbon dioxide into glucose,
ODD: and in exchange, give off oxygen!
MRS. HERTZ: Odd, if you keep this up,
MRS. HERTZ: you'll be teaching\Nthe class instead of me.
ODD: Oh, I certainly don't know\Nas much as you, Misses Hertz.
MRS. HERTZ: I'm beginning to wonder.
ULRICH: Just think. Now I'll have to\Nstart all over again with Sissi.
JEREMIE: Don't even bother, Ulrich.
JEREMIE: I need you too much on Lyoko\Nto help the others deactivate the tower.
ULRICH: But what about Sissi?
JEREMIE: We'll find another way.
ULRICH: Fair enough.
ULRICH: I really don't think I could be\Nas clever as yesterday.
ULRICH: Not like Odd.
JEREMIE: Transfer Yumi.
JEREMIE: Transfer Aelita.
JEREMIE: Scanner Yumi.
JEREMIE: Scanner Aelita.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
ODD: Welcome to Lyoko, ladies.
JEREMIE: The activated tower is on\Nthe second plateau to the north.
JEREMIE: Sorry, but you're gonna\Nhave to go without vehicles
JEREMIE: because I don't have enough\Nmachine resources to bring them up.
ULRICH: No sweat. It'll be\Njust like the good old days.
ULRICH: Come on. Let's go.
JEREMIE: Good luck.
JEREMIE: I'm gonna try and regain\Ncontrol of jumping back in time.
ODD: It's kind of quiet.
ULRICH: Too quiet if you ask me.
ODD: You can never really enjoy the\Npresent moment, can you, Ulrich?
DEFAULT: (BUZZING)
ULRICH: Oh, yes I can.
YUMI: Jeremie, XANA is\Nsending us monsters.
JEREMIE: So I see.
JEREMIE: Separate their flight pattern.
JEREMIE: That ought to weaken them.
YUMI: Odd, take Aelita to the tower.
YUMI: Ulrich and I will take care\Nof the monsters.
JEREMIE: Dive! On your right!
JEREMIE: It should be a path\Nthat leads to the tower!
ODD: With a platform to land on?
JEREMIE: Well, logically, yes.
ODD: That's encouraging!
ODD: Geronimo!
AELITA: (SCREAMS)
ULRICH: They're here. Ready?
YUMI: Mmhmm.
ULRICH: Super sprint!
YUMI: Hiyah!
AELITA: You know very well\Nthat isn't true.
MR. DELMAS: Hmm…these little\Nmachines work very well!
SISSI: Daddy! That's not the point!
SISSI: You heard what they said!
MR. DELMAS: Yes, it's, uh, strange, indeed.
MR. DELMAS: I'll call Della Robbia's parents\Nto get to the bottom of this.
DEFAULT: (DISTANT SCREAMING)
JEREMIE: Nice jump. But it just\Ncost you each 20 life points.
ODD: It was worth it.\NWe can see the tower.
ULRICH: Jeremie. The hornets are\Nattacking Aelita and Odd.
JEREMIE: Got it. Odd, get ready for guests.
JEREMIE: Three hornets are heading for you.
AELIA: Shh. Odd, listen.
ODD: You hide. I’ll take care of it.
JEREMIE: Odd! Time’s running out!
JEREMIE: XANA’s starting another\Njump back in time!
YUMI: Ulrich!
JEREMIE: Ulrich, go and give Odd a hand.
ULRICH: I’m on it!
ULRICH: (SCREAMS)
ODD: Laser arrow!
ULRICH: Super sprint!
ULRICH: Odd! Yours!
ODD: Ha ha ha!
JEREMIE: If only I had more time\Nto find a solution!
YUMI: Cheer up, Jeremie.\NYou’re about to get another day.
MR. DELMAS: So then, madam,\Nyou have never heard
MR. DELMAS: this young girl who is\Nsupposedly your son’s cousin?
DEFAULT: No, I assure you.
MR. DELMAS: Sorry to have disturbed you.
RADIO: It’s Tuesda--
RADIO: No, you're not dreaming!
RADIO: Or, rather, you're\Nnot dreaming anymore!
RADIO: It's already 7 o'clock\Nin the mor--
SISSI: (YAWNS)
JEREMIE: Oh, no! I don’t believe it!
JEREMIE: Aelita is still on Lyoko!
ULRICH: We’ve got to get back\Nto the factory. Pronto.
JEREMIE: Go ahead. I’ll meet you there.
DEFAULT: (HANG UP TONE)
JEREMIE: Sissi, I already know\Nwhat you’re gonna say,
JEREMIE: but I don’t have time.
SISSI: Don't you move.
JEREMIE: (GULPS)
AELITA: But what are you doing?
AELITA: I need you over here.
YUMI: We’re waiting for Jeremie.
YUMI: Without him, we can’t do anything.
JEREMIE: Leave your message.\NI’ll call you back.
ULRICH: Still no answer.
ODD: Okay. We'll find him.
JEREMIE: Sissi, you’re not yourself.
JEREMIE: XANA has possessed you.
JEREMIE: You must not obey him!
SISSI: I’ve never felt so good!
JEREMIE: No!
SISSI: (GROWLS)
SISSI: (SHRIEKS)
SISSI: Ah, there you are!
SISSI: Help me to transport\Nthis simpleton to a safer place.
AELITA: Yumi. They saw me.
DEFAULT: (RUMBLING)
YUMI: Aelita?
YUMI: Aelita!
SISSI: Perfect!
SISSI: They’ll never think of\Nlooking for him here.
HERB: But, Sissi, what’s going on?
SISSI: You! Be quiet!
JEREMIE: Odd! Ulrich! Look out.\NSissi is possessed by XANA!
SISSI: (GROWLS)
HERB: Can you see anything?
NICHOLAS: Absolutely nothing!
NICHOLAS: But I think we'd better\Nget out of here!
SISSI: (SNARLS)
SISSI: Hraaah!
ULRICH: Go on. I’ll handle her.
JEREMIE: Are you sure?
ULRICH: Get going, will ya?
JEREMIE: Good luck.
AELITA: (PANTING)
ODD: How did XANA learn to\Npossess people?
JEREMIE: It looks like he's\Nincreased his powers.
ODD: Brilliant, Einstein! But how!
JEREMIE: With…the jumps back in time!
ODD: You think so?
JEREMIE: I sure do.
JEREMIE: The super calculator\Nis a quantum computer
: that uses the properties of qubytes.
JEREMIE: Every time you add qubytes,\Nits power theoretically doubles.
JEREMIE: I think the po--
ODD: Jeremie, do you mind\Nsaying that in English?
JEREMIE: Well, the super calculator is so powerful\Nthat it can undoubtedly do it.
YUMI: Oh, no! The Scyphozoa!
DEFAULT: (SCREECHING)
YUMI: Oh, there you are at last!\NAelita’s in trouble!
ULRICH: Ah!
DEFAULT: (WHIRRING)
JEREMIE: Virtualization!
ODD: Laser arrow!
JEREMIE: XANA’s started another\Njump back in time.
JEREMIE: We might have to\Nstart all over again!
ODD: I’d really rather not, Jeremie!
YUMI: Aelita, are you alright?
AELITA: Yeah.
YUMI: We just have to make it\Nto that darn tower!
ODD: And we’re not there yet.
JEREMIE: This may be the code that I need!
YUMI: We won’t get a second chance.
ODD: No sweat. I’ll cover you.
JEREMIE: It’s gotta work!
JEREMIE: I can’t believe it! I actually did it!
JEREMIE: I've stopped the jump back in time!
: Hiyah!
DEFAULT: (SCREECHES)
ULRICH: Sissi! No!
AELITA: Tower deactivated.
SISSI: W-What’s going on?
SISSI: What am I doing here?
SISSI: Oh, no! My walkman!
SISSI: My minidisc!
ULRICH: Sissi doesn’t remember a thing.
ULRICH: It’s as if nothing ever happened.
YUMI: Lucky for us.
YUMI: Misses Hertz already gave each of us
YUMI: four hours of detention\Nfor skipping her class.
ODD: You know, if our homework\Nis on photosynthesis,
ODD: I just might get the only\Ngood grade of my entire career
ODD: as a scholastic washout!
JEREMIE: Anyway, we now know that\NXANA can control people.
AELITA: We also know that jumping\Nback in time increases his power.
ULRICH: We’re going to have to be very careful.
ULRICH: The next round is gonna\Nbe tougher than ever.
