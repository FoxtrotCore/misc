JEREMIE: Now, let's see.
JEREMIE: Wow! Unbelievable!
ULRICH: Come on, Jeremie, let's get a move on!
ULRICH: Otherwise, there won't be\Nany hot water left.
JEREMIE: Hey, remember The Hermitage?
ULRICH: You mean the house where\NAelita had those visions?
ULRICH: Bad memory, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Right. Well, I wanted to\Ncheck it out a little closer,
JEREMIE: and I found out something amazing!
ODD: What would really be amazing
ODD: Is if there are still some eggs left\Nwhen we get down to breakfast!
JEREMIE: Odd, you're a real walking stomach,\Nyou know that?
ODD: And you're a walking brain!
ODD: You see? We compliment each other!
JEREMIE: I did a little research to find out\Nwho that old house belonged to,
JEREMIE: and I came across a restricted access site.
JEREMIE: It took me most of the night to hack into it,
JEREMIE: but it was worth it!
JEREMIE: I found a deed signed\Nby a Mr. Franz Hopper.
JEREMIE: Seems that he's the owner.
ULRICH: And do you think it has\Nsomething to do with Lyoko?
ODD: Ulrich, there's a secret\Nunderground passage
ODD: into the sewers from\Nhis yard, believe it or not,
ODD: so the guy must've had something\Nto do with the supercomputer!
JEREMIE: Exactly.
JEREMIE: So, I did a search on\NFranz Hopper, and guess what.
JEREMIE: He was a science teacher\Nright here at Kadic Academy.
JEREMIE: Is that weird or what!
DEFAULT: (WEARY CHATTER)
SISSI: Ha!
DEFAULT: Finally! It's about time!
MILLY: Every morning, it's the same thing!
MILLY: Yeah. But things might start\Nmoving now that Sissi's done.
SISSI: Shut up, kiddies!
SISSI: Poor thing!
SISSI: You'll be here for\Nanother two hours!
SISSI: Why not go upstairs?
SISSI: There's some showers free up there,\Nand not a girl in sight.
DEFAULT: (CLAMORING)
ODD: The girl's showers\Nare downstairs, Aelita!
JIM: Aelita Stones! Hey!
JIM: what do you think you're doing here?
ULRICH: Please go easy on her, Jim.
ULRICH: She's new here.
JIM: Right. Well, new or not,
JIM: a young lady has no business\Nin the boy's showers.
AELITA: But I-I thought that--
JIM: I don't want to hear your excuses!
JIM: Pull that again, and you go\Nstraight to the principal's office!
JIM: Hmph!
SISSI: Well, Miss Einstein,\Nit's just like I said, huh.
SISSI: Not a single girl\Nin these showers.
ULRICH: Sissi, we're sick of\Nyour bad jokes, so chill.
ULRICH: Can't you give Aelita\Na break for once?
ULRICH: You knew she'd believe you, right?
SISSI: What can I say, Ulrich sweetie,
SISSI: she's gonna have to adapt, isn't she?
SISSI: It's a jungle out there.
ODD: You can say that again!
ODD: I'm looking at a\Nbig baboon right now!
DEFAULT: (LAUGHS)
SISSI: Shut up, you!
ODD: Sissi's such a brat.
ODD: And to think you guys\Nactually kissed once.
ULRICH: Hey, cool it, huh.
ULRICH: That's ancient history.
YUMI: So, you think the\Nowner of the Hermitage
YUMI: and the science teacher\Nare the same person?
ULRICH: Well, let's face it, huh.
ULRICH: Finding two guys called Franz Hopper
ULRICH: in a radius of less than half a mile
ULRICH: would sure be a real coincidence.
JEREMIE: Anyway, there's only\None way to be sure.
JEREMIE: After history class, we have\Na study period in the library.
JEREMIE: What do you say we do a little research\Nin the Kadic Academy archives?
ODD: Good idea.
AELITA: I'll go with you.
JEREMIE: I don't think that's a good idea.
JEREMIE: You already got into trouble\Nin the showers this morning.
JEREMIE: if Jim catches you snooping\Naround in the archives,
JEREMIE: you'll be suspended for sure.
JEREMIE: Okay. See you later.
JEREMIE: We'll meet you in the cafeteria.
DEFAULT: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
YUMI: Are you alright, Aelita?
AELITA: I can't get used to living here.
AELITA: I had another nightmare last night.
AELITA: The same one.
YUMI: You haven't even been here for a week yet!
YUMI: You'll see. You'll feel better in no time.
JEREMIE: E, F, G, H…
JEREMIE: H for Hopper.
MRS. WEBER: (HUMMING)
ULRICH: Ah, shoot.
MRS. WEBER: Shouldn't you be in class?
MRS. WEBER: Well, children?
ULRICH: We're looking for um…a teacher!
MRS. WEBER: Oh, really? Which one?
ULRICH: Misses Meyer.
ODD: Mister Charden!
DEFAULT: (LAUGH NERVOUSLY)
JEREMIE: Hopper, Hopper…
JEREMIE: Bingo!
MRS. WEBER: Err…come to think of it,
MRS. WEBER: at this time of day, if you\Ncan't find your teachers,
MRS. WEBER: it probably means they're in class.
JEREMIE: It's okay, guys!
JEREMIE: I found Mrs. Hertz!
JEREMIE: Mam.
MRS. WEBER: (SIGHS)
DEFAULT: Hey! What are you waiting for?
DEFAULT: Come on, huh!\NWill you move it?
ROSA: Well, sweetie!
ROSA: Franks and beans or\Nsteak and potatoes?
AELITA: Uh, well, uh…
DEFAULT: Come on, hurry up!
DEFAULT: We're starving over here!
ROSA: Hmph.
ROSA: Oh?
DEFAULT: Our turn!
DEFAULT: About time!
ODD: Boy, that was a close one.
ULRICH: Well?
JEREMIE: No doubt about it.
JEREMIE: I compared the teacher's signature
JEREMIE: with the one on the property deed\NI found on the internet.
JEREMIE: They're the same.
ULRICH: Hmm.
ULRICH: What if we had a look\Naround the Hermitage
ULRICH: to find out more\Nabout this teacher?
JEREMIE: Good idea.
ODD: But…aren't we supposed to\Nmeet Aelita in the cafeteria now?
JEREMIE: It'll only take a minute.\NShe won't mind waiting a little.
AELITA: Yumi!
SISSI: So?
SISSI: Going back to the great white north?
AELITA: Why not?
AELITA: At least I'd feel at home there!
ULRICH: Still looks as creepy as ever.
ULRICH: What are we looking for?
JEREMIE: How should I know?
JEREMIE: If this Franz Hopper guy\Nhas anything to do with XANA,
JEREMIE: maybe we'll find some information\Nabout Aelita's virus for a start.
ULRICH: Well?
JEREMIE: Not much. Physics textbooks.
JEREMIE: Planck, Heisenberg, Schrödinger…
JEREMIE: Hey!
JEREMIE: What's this doing here?
ULRICH: "The Tunic Wars?"
ULRICH: What's that?
JEREMIE: Punic, not tunic.
JEREMIE: The war between the Romans\Nand the Carthaginians.
JEREMIE: We studied it last year.
JEREMIE: Don't you remember anything?
ULRICH: No.
ODD: You really are lame in history.
JEREMIE: You see all these notes?
JEREMIE: I'm sure Hopper wrote them.
MRS. HERTZ: Quiet, please. Where's Aelita Stones?
MRS. HERTZ: Jeremie, do you know\Nwhy Aelita isn't here?
JEREMIE: Aelita? Huh!
ODD: Uh…huh?
JEREMIE: Um…sorry, mam, I don't.
SISSI: Well, I do, mam!\NShe went back to Canada!
JEREMIE: Canada?
SISSI: Yeah, that's what she told me!
SISSI: She even said, "At least I\Nfeel at home there."
MRS. HERTZ: Elizabeth, if you continue to\Ndisrupt the class, I warn you,
MRS. HERTZ: I will send you to your father's office.
SISSI: (mutters):\NIt's Sissi, not Elizabeth!
SISSI: I hate being called Elizabeth!
JEREMIE: Mam, um, I don't feel very well.
JEREMIE: Can I please go to the infirmary?
MRS. HERTZ: Of course, Jeremie.
ULRICH: Can we take him?
ODD: Can we take him?
MRS. HERTZ: Well, oh…
MRS. HERTZ: Oh, alright, then.
MRS. HERTZ: But don't dilly-dally!
ODD: Jeremie, wait! Hey!
ULRICH: Where are you going?
JEREMIE: To the factory!
ODD: You think Aelita's there?
JEREMIE: She told Sissi she was\Ngoing back to Canada.
JEREMIE: I think she meant, "I'm going back\Nto the place I came from,"
JEREMIE: which means Lyoko.
JEREMIE: Okay. I found her.
JEREMIE: She virtualized herself all on her own.
ODD: That's pretty weird.
ODD: Why would she do that?
ULRICH: Maybe she got homesick.
JEREMIE: Does Yumi know?
ULRICH: I left her a message.
JEREMIE: Get to the scanner room. Hurry!
JEREMIE: Aelita, can you hear me?
JEREMIE: Answer me!
JEREMIE: Ah, Yumi!
YUMI: I got the message\Nat the swimming pool.
YUMI: What's going on?
JEREMIE: Run to the scanner room.
JEREMIE: Ulrich and Odd are already there.\NI'll explain later.
AELITA: Jeremie, help!
JEREMIE: Aelita! Don't worry.\NThe others are on the way.
JEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE: Transfer Yumi.
JEREMIE: Scanner and virtualization!
JEREMIE: Do you see her?
ULRICH: Not yet.
JEREMIE: She's due north!
ULRICH: Let's go.
AELITA: (PANTING)
AELITA: Jeremie, I'm surrounded!
JEREMIE: Hurry up! Aelita's fallen into a trap!
AELITA: (SCREAMS)
ODD: Go ahead, Ulrich.
ODD: With your speed,\Nyou'll get there first.
ULRICH: You're right.
YUMI: Too late.
YUMI: Krab.
JEREMIE: There's another one behind you!
ULRICH: Okay. Battle stations.
JEREMIE: Aelita's bought some time.
ULRICH: Your move, Odd.
ODD: I love this.
YUMI: Hiyah!
ODD: Laser arrow!
JEREMIE: Nice going, guys.
JEREMIE: But hurry it up!
JEREMIE: The bloks are catching up to Aelita.
ODD: What are you waiting for? Call us a taxi!
JEREMIE: It's on the way.
AELITA: Hurry, Jeremie!
JEREMIE: Vehicle materialization.
ODD: Here we go!
JEREMIE: The others are coming to get you.
AELITA: (SCREAMS)
JEREMIE: Aelita!
ODD: What? She's already gone?
ODD: She must really be mad at us.
JEREMIE: This is no time for jokes, Odd.
JEREMIE: I've lost Aelita from my screens.
YUMI: You…you mean she's…
JEREMIE: No! Uh, I doubt it.
JEREMIE: I think she's disappeared\Nfrom the screens as if…
JEREMIE: Wait.
JEREMIE: What's going on?
JEREMIE: Got it! I got a signal!
JEREMIE: A very weak one, but…
JEREMIE: Hey, that's strange.
JEREMIE: Aelita's not in this sector anymore.
JEREMIE: She's not in any sector, actually.
ULRICH: Wait.
ULRICH: Can you explain that a little better?
JEREMIE: No. Not really.
JEREMIE: Let's just say she's in\Na sector…that doesn't exist.
JEREMIE: A fifth sector.
ODD: Huh?
: A fifth sector?
ODD: Have you gone bananas or what!
JEREMIE: No. If I could just fix this thing!
JEREMIE: Maybe I…
JEREMIE: "Welcome to Carthage?"
DEFAULT: (WHIRRING)
YUMI: Is this gonna take long, Jeremie?
JEREMIE: I hope not.
ODD: Uh-oh. Now things are\Nreally starting to buzz.
ULRICH: Super sprint!
ULRICH: Jeremie, what are we doing?
JEREMIE: Wait. I've got a little problem.
ODD: That's no biggie!\NAs long as it's not a biggie!
JEREMIE: I need a password.
JEREMIE: Something to do with Carthage, I think.
ULRICH: This is no time for a history lesson!
JEREMIE: A history lesson!\NThat's exactly what I need!
JEREMIE: That'd be too easy.
ODD: Laser arrow!
JEREMIE: Hannibal…
JEREMIE: Carthage general…
JEREMIE: His father? No…
ULRICH: Hey, Jeremie!\NAny day now!
JEREMIE: Hannibal's sister? Salambo?
DEFAULT: (MOANS)
JEREMIE: The nemesis of Carthage?
JEREMIE: No dice!
ODD: Whenever you're ready, Einstein!
JEREMIE: Hey, you guys, I'm doing my best!
YUMI: Jeremie, we're not gonna last much longer.
JEREMIE: I'm sure I'm gonna get it!
YUMI: Oh, no. I can't believe this.
JEREMIE: I'm going around in circles!
JEREMIE: "Welcome to Carthage!"
JEREMIE: Let's see. You've got to\Ngo into Carthage…
JEREMIE: You have to defeat Carthage.
JEREMIE: Who defeated the Carthaginians?
JEREMIE: Scipio!
JEREMIE: S-C-I-P-I-O!
JEREMIE: Come on!
JEREMIE: I can't believe it!
YUMI: Hey, the hornets are calling it quits.
ODD: Come back, you cowards!
ULRICH: What's that ball doing there?
JEREMIE: I think the codeword\NScipio made it appear.
YUMI: Hey!
ULRICH: Hey!
YUMI: Whoa!
ULRICH: How did you do that, Jeremie?
JEREMIE: Let's just say I got a little\Nhelp from Franz Hopper.
JEREMIE: Welcome to sector five, everyone.
YUMI: What does it look like?
JEREMIE: A sphere that…
JEREMIE: Uh…it's probably bad news.
AELITA: Jeremie! Jeremie!
JEREMIE: I think Aelita is being attacked\Nand time is almost up!
YUMI: Can you guide us?
JEREMIE: Take the footbridge behind you.
JEREMIE: Hurry up! This is no time for sightseeing!
AELITA: (SCREAMS)
ULRICH: Super sprint!
JEREMIE: Hey, what's going on?
ULRICH: Uh…Jeremie, there's\Nthis thing in here.
JEREMIE: Destroy it! That thing is\Ntaking away Aelita's memory!
JEREMIE: Something weird's happening.
JEREMIE: Oh, no! That can't be good!
JEREMIE: Get out of there!
ULRICH: Got it.
JEREMIE: Odd, beat it!
JEREMIE: Just in time!
AELITA: (PANTING)
ULRICH: Now, what?
JEREMIE: Wait. I'm re-entering the code.
JEREMIE: Scipio.
ODD: We've got your ticket out of here, Aelita.
JEREMIE: And there you go.
JEREMIE: I'm bringing you in right now.
JEREMIE: Aelita, all you have to do\Nis get to the tower, and I'll
JEREMIE: rematerialize you.
JEREMIE: Materialization Yumi.
JEREMIE: Materialization Odd.
JEREMIE: Materialization Ulrich.
JEREMIE: (SIGHS)
ODD: You should've seen it, Jeremie.
ODD: There were all these creepy things,
ODD: and in the middle, this kind of\Nhuge jellyfish holding Aelita!
KIWI: (GROWLS)
AELITA: Can you imagine? That thing\Nwas stealing my memory.
JEREMIE: Yeah. One thing is sure --
JEREMIE: XANA wants to get something\Nout of you, but what?
JEREMIE: That's what we have to find out.
ULRICH: I can't wait to go back to the fifth sector.
ULRICH: There's so much to explore there.
YUMI: I'll go with you.\NIt'll be totally awesome.
JEREMIE: Whoa, not so fast!
JEREMIE: I have to study it first!
JEREMIE: For now, it's uncharted territory,
JEREMIE: which means it could be\Ntotally dangerous!
AELITA: Um…you're not angry at me for\Ngoing back to Lyoko by myself?
AELITA: I…I don't know what got into me.
AELITA: I just needed to…
JEREMIE: You don't have to explain, Aelita.
JEREMIE: We understand what happened.
JEREMIE: And we're not angry at all.
JEREMIE: I promise to spend\Nmore time with you.
ODD: Yeah! And if you want,
ODD: I'll teach you plenty of ways\Nto tell Sissi to go to--
SISSI: Odd!
SISSI: Do you know what your\Nfilthy mutt did in the shower?
SISSI: Oh!
SISSI: What a pretty picture!
SISSI: So, you've finally found\NMisses Einstein!
ULRICH: Yeah, while you were taking\Nyour third shower of the day.
SISSI: Well, you know, Ulrich dear,
SISSI: a beautiful flower like me\Nneeds to be watered often!
ODD: You--
AELITA: Yes, you never know!\NYou might just sprout a brain!
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
SISSI: Morons!
ULRICH: I think you can give Odd lessons, Aelita.
YUMI: You sure learn fast!
