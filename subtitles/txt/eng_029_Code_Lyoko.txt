JEREMIE: Aelita, hurry!
JEREMIE: Yumi’s only got 10 life points left!
JEREMIE: Get ready, girls.
JEREMIE: I’m starting up the devirtualization process.
ULRICH: Activated towers, Lyoko battles, danger.
ULRICH: Aren’t you guys startin'\Nto get sick of all this?
ODD: No.
JEREMIE: No.
ULRICH: Well, sometimes I really wish\Nwe were done with XANA.
ODD: Uh, you missed an episode, Ulrich.
ODD: Remember, Aelita's\Ncarrying a miserable virus
ODD: that links her to her old friend XANA.
ODD: Bye-bye XANA means bye-bye Aelita.
JEREMIE: And I don’t know how to\Ncreate an anti-virus.
JEREMIE: I mean, not just yet.
AELITA: Hey, I have an idea!
AELITA: Why don't we explore the new\Nmysterious sector we discovered?
JEREMIE: Sector five?
JEREMIE: But we don’t know what’s in it!
ODD: Sure we do!
ODD: There are monsters,\Nultra-dangerous traps,
ODD: and a scyphozoa, as you call it,\Nthat wants to steal Aelita’s memory.
AELITA: You’re right, but what if\Nthere's something else there?
AELITA: Like information about XANA?
AELITA: We have to go back.
ULRICH: Good idea.
ULRICH: All three of us will go.
AELITA: You mean all four of us.
AELITA: I want to be part of this expedition.
JEREMIE: With that scyphozoa slinking around?
JEREMIE: No way.
AELITA: What if there’s a tower to deactivate?
AELITA: Think about it!
AELITA: I have to be there.
ODD: Come on, Einstein!
ODD: With bodyguards like us,\Nshe has nothing to worry about!
ODD: And I promise to be careful!
JEREMIE: Okay.
JEREMIE: Tomorrow night, exploration.
YUMI: (GASPS)\NOh my gosh! It’s so late!
YUMI: My parents must be\Ngoing bananas!
YUMI: Bye! See you tomorrow!
ODD: And as for us, we missed dinner again.
ODD: And when I think it was\Nspaghetti and meatballs!
MR. ISHIYAMA: Yumi, we need to talk.
MR. ISHIYAMA: You come home late\Nevery single night.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Tonight is the last straw.
MR. ISHIYAMA: It’s past 10 o’clock
MR. ISHIYAMA: and you didn't even bother\Nto telephone us.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: And you haven’t eaten anything, either.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: What’s going on, dear?
MRS. ISHIYAMA: If you have a problem,\Nyou know you can tell us.
YUMI: No, really. Everything’s fine.
YUMI: I was studying math at Maïtena’s house.
YUMI: I told you already.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Maïtena Lecuyer?
YUMI: Uh-huh.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Hmm. That’s strange.
MR. ISHIYAMA: When I called her, she was studying.
MR. ISHIYAMA: By herself.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: You’re lying to us, Yumi.\NThat’s not like you.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: What’s the matter with you?
MRS. ISHIYAMA: I worry about you, sweetheart.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Tell me what’s bothering you.
YUMI: I promise you that\Neverything's just fine.
YUMI: You saw my last report card.
YUMI: It was great, so why worry about me?
DEFAULT: (SIGHS)
MRS. ISHIYAMA: I’m concerned, Takeo.
MR. ISHIYAMA: We’re going to have to\Nget a lot more strict.
YUMI: It’s nice of you to come with me,
YUMI: but I’m big enough to go\Nto school alone. Really, I am.
MR. ISHIYAMA: You are, huh?
MR. ISHIYAMA: If you were, then you’d stop lying to us
MR. ISHIYAMA: and tell us why you come\Nhome so late all the time.
YUMI: Are you gonna watch me\N24 hours a day? Is that it?\N
YUMI: Am I in prison or something?
MRS. ISHIYAMA: We’re trying to understand you\Nand to protect you, too.
YUMI: Oh, wow!\NThe entire Ishiyama family!
YUMI: I bet that you’ll be\Npicking me up as well, huh?
MR. ISHIYAMA: I'll be waiting for you\Nhere at 5 o'clock.
MR. ISHIYAMA: I advise you not to be late.
SISSI: Oh, isn’t that adorable!
SISSI: (CACKLES)
YUMI: They’re not gonna ease up on me.
YUMI: Oh, what a mess.
YUMI: The worst thing is\NI hate lying to them.
ODD: Just explain to them that\Nwe’re fighting in a virtual universe
ODD: against a demonic\Nartificial intelligence.
ODD: That ought to reassure them.
YUMI: Dork.
JEREMIE: You’ve got to win back\Ntheir trust in you.
JEREMIE: I think maybe you should\Nstay away from Lyoko for a little while.
YUMI: Huh?
YUMI: What about exploring sector five!
YUMI: It’s for tonight, isn’t it?
ULRICH: Don’t worry. Jeremie will\Ngive you a play-by-play update.
JEREMIE: Promise.
: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
ODD: Come on, guys.
ODD: I know you’re all dying to go\Nto Mrs. Hertz's class. Off we go.
JEREMIE: Did you study for the\Nmarine biology test?
ODD: Of course I did! Listen.
ODD: Fish are remarkably\Nwell adapted to water.
ODD: What’s more, they can swim.
JEREMIE: You are so lame.
DEFAULT: (LAUGHTER)
JEREMIE: Off to the forest sector!
JEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE: Transfer Aelita.
JEREMIE: Scanner Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Scanner Aelita.
JEREMIE: Scanner Odd.
JEREMIE: Virtualization!
JEREMIE: Everything okay?
ODD: We’re good.\NThe monsters must be sleeping.
ODD: They need all the sleep\Nthey can get to recover from
ODD: all the grief we’ve been giving them.
JEREMIE: You have to get to the\Nother end of the sector
JEREMIE: to take the transporter.
JEREMIE: I’m going to materialize your rides.
ODD: Yahoo!
ODD: Yeah!
ULRICH: Odd, you promised to be careful!
ODD: No problem!
JEREMIE: Go straight ahead and hurry up\Nbefore the monsters get there!
AELITA: We made it, Jeremie!
JEREMIE: Okay. I’m entering the code.
: Scipio.
ODD: There’s the transporter.
ULRICH: Whoa.
YUMI: Are you there, Jeremie?
JEREMIE: Yumi?
YUMI: Everything okay?
JEREMIE: Yumi!
YUMI: Everything okay?
JEREMIE: Yeah, they’re in the transporter.\NAll is well.
YUMI: Tell them I’m thinking about them.
JEREMIE: Happy campers?
ULRICH: Yep. I’m beginning to get\Nused to these little trips.
ODD: Ugh, not me!
ODD: I shouldn’t have had\Nthat fifth dessert at lunch.
AELITA: Jeremie, the wall's about to open.
JEREMIE: Right. Meaning the\Ncountdown's gonna start.
JEREMIE: You’ve got to find a\Nway to deactivate it.
JEREMIE: That must be the answer\Nto exploring further.
JEREMIE: Watch it, guys!
ULRICH: Everything will be fine.
ULRICH: Odd promised to be careful.
JEREMIE: It started!
JEREMIE: You know what'll happen if Aelita\Nloses her life points, don't you!
ULRICH: Don’t worry.
ULRICH: We have no intention of losing her.
AELITA: The last time, there was a big room\Nat the end of this hallway.
JEREMIE: I've got a feeling the\Narchitecture of the core zone
JEREMIE: changes each time you go there.
ODD: That’s a great help\Nfor finding our way around.
ULRICH: If we knew everything,\Nwe wouldn’t be exploring.
ULRICH: Come on. Let’s go!
JEREMIE: Look out! You've got\Ntwo creepers on your tail!
ODD: Laser arrow!
JEREMIE: You’ve only got three minutes\Nleft to stop the countdown! Get going!
ULRICH: That way.
ULRICH: Come on!
ULRICH: Haven’t we already\Nbeen through here?
ODD: How should I know?
ODD: Everything looks\Nthe same in this place!
AELITA: This way!
JEREMIE: Wow, 40 life points in one go!
JEREMIE: Those creepers sure are powerful!
ODD: They’re powerful!
ODD: And really ugly, too!
ULRICH: Jeremie, any ideas?
JEREMIE: No, but I got news for you.
JEREMIE: You’re in a labyrinth.
JEREMIE: Make a left at each fork,\Nand leave a mark there.
JEREMIE: If the way is already marked,\Nthen make a right.
ODD: This is incredible!
ODD: We’ll never get out of this thing!
JEREMIE: You’d better!
JEREMIE: Just two minutes left to find\Na way to stop the countdown!
AELITA: We’re out, Jeremie! We made it!
ODD: Nothing like having\Na little luck on your side.
ODD: Hey, Einstein, why\Ncomplicate things, huh?
ULRICH: Ah, great. Now what do we do?
ODD: Jeremie, can you see\Nanything from your end?
JEREMIE: So, you need me again, huh?
JEREMIE: Go back to where you were.
JEREMIE: I spotted a mechanism on the wall.
JEREMIE: Hurry! Time's running out!
AELITA: There!
ODD: Let me at it!
JEREMIE: Fourteen! Thirteen! Twelve!
JEREMIE: Eleven! Ten! Nine!
JEREMIE: Eight! Seven! Six!
JEREMIE: Five! Four!
ODD: Agh!
ULRICH: No!
ULRICH: Agh!
AELITA: Ulrich!
JEREMIE: Aelita, the countdown is over.
JEREMIE: The room is bound to change now.
JEREMIE: You okay?
AELITA: Well, no more creepers. That’s a start.
JEREMIE: Don’t worry.
JEREMIE: I’ll rematerialize Odd and Ulrich,\Nand I’ll get you out of there.
JEREMIE: Come on, come on!
DEFAULT: (BEEPS)
JEREMIE: Oh, no!
JEREMIE: Aelita, Odd and Ulrich\Ndidn’t come back!
AELITA: What?
AELITA: But that’s impossible. Are they lost?
JEREMIE: For the moment, they are.
AELITA: So there’s no rematerialization\Nfrom sector five?
JEREMIE: Sure there is.
JEREMIE: Once we find the right program.
AELITA: And do you think you can find it?
JEREMIE: It’s probably as easy as\Nfinding your antivirus.
JEREMIE: But don’t worry.\NI'm gonna do the impossible.
YUMI: Hiroki, could you make\Nsome more noise, please?
HIROKI: Sorry, Yumi. The volume's\Nas high as it goes.
MR. IHSIYAMA: Hiroki.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Go into the other room, Hiroki.\NGo on now.
MR. ISHIYAMA: I pass.
YUMI: Me, too. I pass.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Then the game is over!\N(LAUGHS)
MR. ISHIYAMA: I have five points more than you!
YUMI: On the Goban, yes.
YUMI: Don’t forget that I played the whites.
YUMI: With Komi, I win by half a point.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Oh.
YUMI: (YAWNS)
YUMI: Well, it’s bed time.
YUMI: Goodnight.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Goodnight, my dear.
YUMI: Jeremie, how’s it going?
JEREMIE: Badly. Head for the factory.
AELITA: Jeremie?
AELITA: Can you hear that?
JEREMIE: It’s the scyphozoa!
JEREMIE: It’s heading towards you!
JEREMIE: Stay calm. Yumi’s coming.
DEFAULT: (SCREECHING)
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Yumi, can I come in?
MRS. ISHIYAMA: I want to talk to you for a minute.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Huh?
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Yumi?
YUMI: Jeremie, I’m in the elevator.
JEREMIE: You have to get Aelita in sector five!
JEREMIE: The Scyphozoa is there!
YUMI: What about Odd and Ulrich?
JEREMIE: You want the best case scenario?
YUMI: I’d rather.
JEREMIE: I’ve got about a one in a million\Nchance of finding the right code
JEREMIE: to bring them back.
JIM: (YAWNS)
MR. ISHIYAMA: So sorry to bother you at such\Na late hour, Headmaster Delmas,
MRS. ISHIYAMA: but we’re very worried.
MR. DELMAS: Yes, yes. I understand.\NBut it’s quite possible
MR. DELMAS: that Yumi is somewhere on the campus.
JIM: Why, sure!
JIM: She’s probably hanging out\Nwith her little gang of friends.
JIM: Come on.
JEREMIE: You’re on the edge of the territory, Yumi.
JEREMIE: Better be careful.
JEREMIE: XANA’s going to do all that he can\Nto keep you from taking the transporter.
YUMI: Jeremie! Enter…the code!
JEREMIE: Yumi?
JIM: Huh. No one’s here.
MR. DELMAS: No one’s in Stern’s room either.
SISSI: Looking for someone?
MR. DELMAS: Uh, Sissi. Would you\Nknow where your friends
MR. DELMAS: Stern, Belpois, and\NDella Robbia might be?
SISSI: Probably up to no good. As usual.
SISSI: But I don’t know where.
SISSI: Although, their little mascot\Ncan find them for you.
MR. DELMAS: Mascot? What mascot?
SISSI: Tada!
JIM: A flea-bitten mangy mutt!
JIM: Huh. Well, excuse me, Mr. Delmas.
SISSI: Ew. Hey, little puppy.
SISSI: Where’s your master, huh?
SISSI: Go get him!
KIWI: (YAPS)
MRS. ISHIYAMA: Let’s follow him!
JEREMIE: Hang in there, Aelita.
JEREMIE: Yumi’s on the way.
AELITA: I hope so.
JEREMIE: Yumi? Can you hear me?
YUMI: Yes. I’m in the arena.
YUMI: The transporter got to me just in time.
YUMI: Horrible Kankrelat.
JEREMIE: Listen up, now.
JEREMIE: You have to get to the corridor\Nand trigger the mechanism
JEREMIE: before the countdown runs out, okay?
YUMI: Okay.
JEREMIE: If I’m right about how\Nthe core zone functions,
JEREMIE: my plan should work.
JIM: Huh. What’s the matter with that hound?
JIM: Oh, I don’t believe it!
JIM: This reminds me of when I\Nused to work in the sewers.
MR. DELMAS: You, uh, used to work in the sewers, Jim?
JIM: I, uh…I’d rather not talk about it.
JEREMIE: Only two minutes left, Yumi!
JEREMIE: Down to 10 points, Yumi!
JEREMIE: This is not the time to mess up!
JIM: That’s weird.
KIWI: (BARKS
JIM: (SQUEALS)
MR. DELMAS: Jim, we’re wasting time!
JIM: Will you let go of that slipper! You flea-bitten--
JIM: Come on! Let go of it!
JEREMIE: Yumi, this is no time to drag your feet.
JEREMIE: I’ve located the mechanism.\NIt’s on your right.
JEREMIE: You have ten seconds!
JEREMIE: Two seconds!
YUMI: It works, Jeremie!
JEREMIE: The whole zone is being reconfigured!
JEREMIE: We did it!
JEREMIE: Aelita, take the access behind you!
YUMI: Huh?
YUMI: Wow!
YUMI: It’s some kind of elevator!
JEREMIE: You know what we do\Nwith elevators, right?
YUMI: We ride 'em!
AELITA: Yumi!
JEREMIE: Try to grab Aelita as you go by!
AELITA: Where are you taking me?
YUMI: I have no idea.
YUMI: There’s an interface!
AELITA: I can get in.
AELITA: Incredible!
JEREMIE: What?
AELITA: It’s unbelieveable.
AELITA: The interface gives access…
AELITA: to XANA’s own data!
JEREMIE: Huh?
AELITA: Sector five is where XANA lives!
YUMI: XANA’s not a very good housekeeper.
YUMI: There’s some weird things\Nhanging around this place.
AELITA: I’ve got access to all kinds of data. It’s crazy!
JEREMIE: Look for the specific\Ndevirtualization code for sector five.
JEREMIE: If you find it, we can\Nrescue Odd and Ulrich!
YUMI: Jeremie, I’m gonna need the Overwing.
JEREMIE: Uh-oh. Bad news.
JEREMIE: When Aelita’s working on the interface,\NI can’t do anything from my end.
AELITA: I think I found it. I’m transmitting it to you.
JEREMIE: Okay. I’m taking over again now.
MR. DELMAS: What would a nice girl like Yumi doing here?
JIM: Where are we, anyway?
YUMI: Jeremie, the Overwing! Now!
JEREMIE: It’s on the way!
YUMI: How do we get out of here?
AELITA: There are some tunnels.
YUMI: They’re closed!
JEREMIE: Lets see.
JEREMIE: Tunnels…
: What if…
JEREMIE: What if they corresponded to those\Nthat open onto the arena?
JEREMIE: Yippie! It works!
YUMI: Nice one, Einstein!
AELITA: Yumi!
AELITA: Jeremie, I got out through a way tower!
JEREMIE: Okay. Now get to a neutral tower.\NI’ll bring you in!
JEREMIE: Okay. I’m ready, Aelita.
JEREMIE: Code: Earth.
AELITA: It's okay, Jeremie. I’m here.
AELITA: But what about the others?
JEREMIE: I’m entering the new code!
JEREMIE: Materialization Yumi!
JEREMIE: Materialization Odd!
JEREMIE: Materialization Ulrich!
JEREMIE: Now all we can do is hope.
JEREMIE: Yeah!
AELITA: We did it!
JEREMIE: Odd!
JEREMIE: How you feel? Say something!
ODD: Something!
ODD: Kiwi!
MR. ISHIYAMA: Yumi? What are you doing here?
MR. DELMAS: I believe you all have\Nsome explaining to do.
JIM: Hey!
JIM: Ah ha!
JIM: Trying to outsmart me, huh?
JIM: What the…
JIM: Belpois!
JIM: W-What?
JIM: What is this place?
JEREMIE: Nothing rings a bell, Jim?
JEREMIE: Funny 'cause you’ve\Nbeen here before.
JIM: What are you talking about?\NI don’t remember this!
JEREMIE: Well, yes and no.
JIM: Huh?
JEREMIE: Return to the past now.
MR. ISHIYAMA: So, then. You still refuse\Nto give us an explanation?
YUMI: Alright, I’ll tell you.
YUMI: I’m in love.
MR. ISHIYAMA: Ah, Yumi, I knew there was a reason.
MRS. ISHIYAMA: And would you tell us\Nyour boyfriend’s name?
YUMI: No. Sorry, I won’t mom.
YUMI: See you tonight.
SISSI: Ugh!
ULRICH: Well, that sure seemed to\Nsatisfy your parents.
YUMI: What did you tell them?
YUMI: The truth.
