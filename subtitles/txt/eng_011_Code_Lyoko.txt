JEREMIE: But I can’t speak any louder--\NI’m in a library now.
AELITA: What’s a library, Jeremie?
JEREMIE: A data bank where\Neverything’s printed on paper.
JEREMIE: And where you can’t make any noise!
AELITA: Oh, I guess because you need silence\Nto concentrate on what you’re studying.
JEREMIE: Yes, and so as not to miss the match point!
JIM: Hey, quiet!
ODD: Ye-a-a-a-a-ah!
YUMI: Game set and match!
ULRICH: Yeah!
JIM: Ulrich!
JIM: Is that what you call studying?
JIM: In case no one told you,\Nthis is not the school yard!
JIM: You are here to work, okay!
JIM: And work means silence!
JIM: And no more games from now on!
JIM: Ah! Okay, well, if that’s the\Nway you want to play,
JIM: I can play just as hard\Nas you can, my little friends!
JIM: Y-o-o-o-o-u!
JIM: Two hours detention!\NI'm--!
JIM: Sorry about that, sir, I uh…
MR. DELMAS: Hello there, Jeremie.
MR. DELMAS: Would you come to my office now?\NI want to talk to you. It’s very important.
ODD: Jeremie?
YUMI: What’s going on?
JEREMIE: Well, you know the principal.\NHe went on and on.
JEREMIE: He says the school psychologist\Nhas been observing me for a long time,
JEREMIE: and he thinks that I’m an…\Noverly-gifted student.
ODD: Is that all? But that’s nothing!
ODD: We were scared that the principal\Nhad found out about the lab! Big deal!
JEREMIE: It’s worse than you think, Odd.
JEREMIE: The shrinks decided that I have to\Ntake all kinds of tests tonight
JEREMIE: to determine what my IQ is.
ULRICH: Yeah, so?
JEREMIE: If the tests show that\NI have a really high IQ,
JEREMIE: the guy is gonna see to it\Nthat I get sent to another school.
ODD: Oh, no!
ODD: Are you saying that he’s gonna send you\Nto a school for like future Einsteins?
JEREMIE: Yeah.
YUMI: That is serious.
YUMI: If you’re not here,\Nwe can never go to Lyoko again,
YUMI: and XANA will be able\Nto do what he wants.
JEREMIE: It’s not just that, guys.
JEREMIE: I don’t want to leave here\Nbecause of you all.
JEREMIE: You’re my friends.
ODD: Hold on, cool it.
ODD: Don’t panic, okay?
ODD: I mean, they can’t\Nforce you to change schools.
JEREMIE: It’s not all that easy.
JEREMIE: The psychologist creep\Ncouldn’t wait to talk to my parents.
JEREMIE: He told them that at that kind of school,\NI’d be entitled to a big scholarship.
JEREMIE: My folks aren’t gonna pass up\Na great chance like that.
JEREMIE: (RINGING)
ODD: What’s the big problem?
ODD: You mess up on the test,\Nand they’ll think you’re a total moron.
ODD: Nobody will ever know,\Nand you’re home free.
JEREMIE: Sure, I thought of that.
JEREMIE: Only there’s a problem\Nbecause tests like that
JEREMIE: are full of all kinds of\Ntrick questions,
JEREMIE: and if you really want to\Nmess up and make mistakes,
JEREMIE: you’ve got to be very clever.
YUMI: But that’s great since\Nyou’re the cleverest kid around!
JEREMIE: Well, okay.
JEREMIE: I’ll do my best to flunk.
JEREMIE: But I can’t promise anything.
YUMI: Uh, I’ll see you guys later.
YUMI: Keep me posted, okay?
MR. KLOTZ: Ah, hello there, Jeremie.
MR. KLOTZ: Do you recognize me?
MR. KLOTZ: I’m Mister Simone,\Nthe school psychologist.
JEREMIE: Of course I do!
JEREMIE: Is it really true that you’re\Nplanning to get me transferred
JEREMIE: to a school for gifted children?
JEREMIE: That’s great! My parents\Nare gonna be so glad!
MR. KLOTZ: Well, that’s what we’re\Nhere tonight to find out.
MR. KLOTZ: Now, to start off, I’m going to\Ngive you a multiple choice test.
MR. KLOTZ: It’s a test in which you…
MR. KLOTZ: oh, I’m sorry, I’m sure\Nyou already know.
JEREMIE: Me? No.
MR. KLOTZ: Oh.
ULRICH: So, what’s for dinner?
ODD: Oh, I don’t know. Some kind of hash.\NThey all taste the same.
SISSI: (SCREAMS)
SISSI: Oh, no, it can’t be!
SISSI: My brand-new Guuki dress!
SISSI: I don’t believe it!
SISSI: Ah! So you’re the savage that did this!
SISSI: (SQUEALS)
SISSI: Here, take that!
DEFAULT: (PULSING)
AELITA: Jeremie!
AELITA: Jeremie, listen!
AELITA: XANA’s woken up.\NHe must be preparing an attack.
AELITA: Jeremie?
JEREMIE: Sir, don’t you think we ought to stop?
MR. KLOTZ: But that would be silly, huh?
MR. KLOTZ: The tests are almost finished.
MR. KLOTZ: Besides, the lights are\Nbound to come on again.
MR. KLOTZ: Ah.
SISSI: Oh, what kind of a\Ntwo-bit school is this?
RATS: (SQUEAKING)
SISSI: Huh?
RATS: (SCREECHING)
SISSI: Help!
JIM: That’s enough!
JIM: Get back to your seats\Nright now and quiet down!
JIM: Go on, now! The lights will\Ncome on again soon.
JIM: Now stop all your\Nclowning around, understand?
JIM: Come on, now!
ULRICH: Shh!
ULRICH: Quiet down! Listen!
RATS: (SQUEAKING)
JIM: What?
JIM: Gaaah!
ULRICH: We’d better get out of here.
JIM: Uh…don’t panic!
ROSA: Take that! And that!
STUDENT: Move, move! Go!
JIM: Don’t panic, I said!\NJust get out of my way!
ULRICH: Oh, no.
ODD: Uh-oh.
ULRICH: We’re trapped.
ODD: Nice going, XANA.
ODD: The rats all waited for night time.
ODD: And they attacked us as soon as\Nwe were all in the cafeteria.
ODD: (RINGING)
YUMI: Is that you, Ulrich?
YUMI: Huh? What?
DEFAULT: (RINGING)
JEREMIE: Oh, but…
MR. KLOTZ: After the test, you can make\Nall the calls you want.
ULRICH: Oh, what’s the matter!\NWhy doesn’t he answer?
ODD: The extinguishers, Jim! Hurry up!
JIM: Don’t panic!
JIM: J-Just don’t p-p-panic, okay!
ODD: Pass them down!
ODD: Okay, outside, everyone!
ODD: There are way too many of them!
ODD: We’ll never be able\Nto hold them back all night!
SISSI: Help! Help!
SISSI: Over here!
ULRICH: Sissi?
ULRICH: What’s she doing here, anyway?
ODD: We have to help her,\Nor she’s gonna be eaten alive!
MR. KLOTZ: That noise is unbearable.
MR. KLOTZ: Listen, this racket has got to--
MR. KLOTZ: Daaah!
MR. KLOTZ: Aaah!
MR. KLOTZ: They’re--they’re rats!\NLike a whole army of them!
JEREMIE: XANA.
JEREMIE: They’re trying to eat through the door.\NWe’ve got to barricade it.
ULRICH: Ah, here she comes!
YUMI: Your carriage, cinderella.
ODD: Welcome to the rat pack!
JEREMIE: Okay, keep going alone, sir.
JEREMIE: Let’s hope this will\Nhold them back long enough.
JEREMIE: Aelita?
AELITA: XANA has activated a tower, Jeremie.
AELITA: I’ve spotted where it is.\NI’m on my way there now.
AELITA: I’ll try and get a closer look, okay?
AELITA: (CELL PHONE RINGS)
YUMI: Hello, Jeremie.
YUMI: Yes, the rats have attacked.
YUMI: Okay, right. We’ll meet at the lab.
YUMI: We have to find a safe place.
ULRICH: Where, huh? The rats are all over.
JIM: I know one! The only place with no access\Nto the sewers is the science building.
JIM: Let’s go!
YUMI: Better hurry.
JEREMIE: Oh, this time we’re the rats in a trap,\Nand I don’t like it at all.
ODD: Hey, get a move on, huh?\NThe extinguishers are nearly empty!
YUMI: Come on. Easy does it.
DEFAULT: Faster!
DEFAULT: Hurry up! Move!
ULRICH: Oh, what do I do now?
YUMI: Okay, let’s go up to the roof.
YUMI: If the rats get in,\Nwe’ll be safe up there.
YUMI: We have to get to the factory.\NJeremie will meet us there.
YUMI: As soon as he can, that is.
ULRICH: Sounds great,\Nbut how do we get there, huh?
ODD: Here I go.
ODD: Yeah!
JIM: Hey, wait! Come back!\NWhat are you doing!
JIM: No, come back!\NHey, come back here! Hey!
ULRICH: Too late!
YUMI: No choice.
YUMI: We have to go over the wall.
MR. KLOTZ: Not rats. Anything but rats.
MR. KLOTZ: W-When I was a boy,\Na rat came up to my…my room.
JEREMIE: Bingo.
JEREMIE: You stay here, sir.\NI got to get to the photo lab.
JEREMIE: Be right back!
ULRICH: XANA’s thought of everything.
ODD: Come on.
ODD: Care for a little cruise?
ODD: (SCREECHING)
YUMI: Faster!
YUMI: Hurry up! Faster! Hurry!
JEREMIE: It worked! Great!
JEREMIE: If they come, use this.\NIt’ll chase them away.
MR. KLOTZ: Stay! P-Please don’t go!
MR. KLOTZ: I’m afraid of rats!
MR. KLOTZ: Oh, no.
YUMI: Hey, Jeremie. I’m in the lab.
YUMI: I have to contact Aelita\Nand virtualize Odd and Ulrich.
YUMI: Explain to me how to do it.
JEREMIE: Listen up, now.
YUMI: Okay, that’s done.
YUMI: I found the activated tower,\Nand I’ve located Aelita.
YUMI: She’s got a problem.
YUMI: What?
YUMI: Speak louder!\NI can hardly hear you!
YUMI: I have to type in the coordinates?
YUMI: Say that again.
YUMI: 19 degrees west?
YUMI: That’s it, isn’t it?\N19 degrees west?
JEREMIE: Wait, no. I said 79 degrees west!
JEREMIE: 79 degrees west!
JEREMIE: Listen, Yumi, the rats have\Ninvaded the city, do you hear?
YUMI: Okay, then. I’m ready.
JEREMIE: Yumi, can you hear me?
YUMI: Transfer Odd.
YUMI: Transfer Ulrich.
YUMI: Scanner Odd.
YUMI: Scanner Ulrich.
YUMI: Virtualization.
ODD: It’s okay. You did it, Yumi.
YUMI: Do you see Aelita?
ULRICH: No. She should be\Naround here somewhere.
YUMI: Oh, no. I didn’t enter\Nthe right coordinates!
YUMI: I virtualized you too far\Naway from Aelita!
ODD: That’s okay. We could use\Na little exercise to get warmed up.
JEREMIE: Smile!
YUMI: Do you see her now?
ODD: Yeah, I see her.
ODD: She’s here.
ODD: The only problem is she’s not alone.
YUMI: Be careful.
ULRICH: Hello, princess.
AELITA: That was close.
AELITA: I just managed to get away.
ULRICH: Your two knights in armor\Nhave come to protect you.
ODD: Hey, you know, this is kinda weird.
YUMI: Odd, Ulrich, what is happening?
ULRICH: That’s a good question.
YUMI: I don’t understand…
YUMI: It could’ve been my mistake, although…
AELITA: It’s XANA.
AELITA: He’s changing the slope of the plateau.\NBetter hang on tight!
DEFAULT: (YELLING)
ODD: Wow! Well done, Aelita!
YUMI: Two krabs, a battery of lasers,\N10 life points lost per impact.
ODD: Ulrich, cover Aelita.
ODD: She’s lost too many life points.\NI’ll try to attract their attention.
ODD: Laser arrow!
ULRICH: No, Odd!
ULRICH: Get out of there now!
ULRICH: Odd! No!
JEREMIE: Need any help?
YUMI: Oh, Jeremie. You’re finally here.
YUMI: Listen, Odd has just been devirtualized,\Nand Ulrich has hardly any life points left.
JEREMIE: Well, you know what\Nyou gotta do now, Yumi.
AELITA: No!
JEREMIE: Go on, Aelita.
JEREMIE: You’re there now. Go on.
MR. KLOTZ: Say…say cheese.
JEREMIE: Return to the past now.
YUMI: Jeremie, hey, did you figure out\Na way to flunk the test, hm?
JEREMIE: Well, now that I know\Nall the questions,
JEREMIE: I shouldn’t have any trouble\Ngiving all the wrong answers.
ULRICH: Are you sure it’s gonna work?
JEREMIE: Anyway, I’ve got a\Nfoolproof way of flunking.
JEREMIE: I’m gonna get all of\Nmy answers from Odd.
ODD: Yeah, yeah.\NGo on, laugh your heads off.
: But who knows?\NYou might be in for a big surprise!
JIM: Quiet!
