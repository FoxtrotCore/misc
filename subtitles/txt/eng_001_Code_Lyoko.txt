MILLY: Okay. Are we rolling?
TAMIYA: Yeah, but we’re upside down!
MILLY: Hello, fellow students\Nof Kadic Junior High!
MILLY: Your ace reporters\NMilly and Tamiya are here
MILLY: to bring you an exclusive\Nfor today’s school news,
MILLY: and it’s really big
MILLY: since as I’m pretty sure\Nyou already know
MILLY: tonight is the big night.
MILLY: The night of our\Nannual school prom.
MILLY: Unfortunately, our cameras\Nweren’t authorized
MILLY: to film the site where\Nthe festivities will take place,
MILLY: but I can make out\Nfrom where I’m speaking
MILLY: the girl who might be crowned\Nour beauty queen tonight,
MILLY: just as she was last year,\NI’m mean, of course,
MILLY: our principal’s daughter, Sissi.
MILLY: Let’s see whether she’ll answer\Na few questions.
MILLY: Well, Sissi?
MILLY: How about a few words\Nfor our TV audience
MILLY: before the big night?
SISSI: Sorry, munchkins.
SISSI: I only talk to real pro reporters.
SISSI: I have no time to waste\Non a couple of nerds!
MILLY: But it’s for the school\Nnews program!
MILLY: What about freedom of the press!
SISSI: Oh, Milly.\NLittle dipsticks your age
SISSI: don’t have any freedom,\Nunderstand?
SISSI: Anyway, who needs\Nyour dumb reporting?
SISSI: What do you know?
SISSI: Besides, you’ve got a problem.
SISSI: Don’t forget you have to have a date,
SISSI: and I don’t know anyone\Nwho’d want to go with a jerk like you.
SISSI: Even them.
SISSI: I’ll bet if you ask them,\Nthey’d run like scared rabbits.
MILLY: Who needs them!\NThere are lots of other boys!
SISSI: Oh, yeah? What are you\Nwaiting for, then?
SISSI: Try and find one!
MILLY: Uh, uh, Ulrich, would you…
MILLY: would you be my date tonight?
ULRICH: Uh…I’m sorry, Milly.
ULRICH: It wouldn’t be a very good idea.
ULRICH: I’m too old for you.
ULRICH: And uh, well,
ULRICH: you see, I promised to go with Yumi.
SISSI: You see?
SISSI: What did I tell you?
SISSI: But don’t worry, Milly.
SISSI: I’m sure you’ll find a boy\Nfor the sandbox dance.
SISSI: Meanwhile, why don’t you\Ngo play with your dolls?
TAMIYA: Milly!
TAMIYA: Milly, wait!
YUMI: I hope you’re proud of yourself.
JEREMIE: Aelita?\NThis is Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Do you read me?
JEREMIE: Aelita?
AELITA: Hi! How are you?
JEREMIE: I’m fine. How about you?
AELITA: Okay.
AELITA: I didn’t see anything unusual\Naround the towers.
AELITA: It all seems quiet.
AELITA: Well, for the moment.
JEREMIE: You know, I’m making progress\Nwith my research,
JEREMIE: so…so you can\Ncome and live with us.
AELITA: The key to materialization?
AELITA: You’ve found it at last!
JEREMIE: Uh…well, no.
JEREMIE: Not yet,\Nbut I’m working on it.
JEREMIE: It’s just a matter of time.
JEREMIE: Then XANA won’t be able to\Ndo anything to harm you or us.
AELITA: That’s great! Thanks.
TAMIYA: Milly, don’t cry.
TAMIYA: We’ll go to the prom.\NYou’ll see.
TAMIYA: As for the news,\NJim said it was okay.
TAMIYA: We have until 9 o’clock.
MILLY: Oh, it’s a waste of time.
MILLY: Better face facts, Tamiya.
MILLY: They don’t care about us\Nor the newscast.
MILLY: Oh, I hate them.\NAll of them.
MILLY: I hate every single\None of them.
MILLY: I hate everybody\Nin the world.
TAMIYA: You don’t know what you’re saying.\NIt’s just that--
MILLY: Oh, stop it! I’m sick of you, too,\Nso just leave me alone!
TAMIYA: Hey!
TAMIYA: It’s true Ulrich could’ve been a little nicer.
YUMI: Don’t look so gloomy, Ulrich.
YUMI: Is it because of Milly?
YUMI: You could’ve said yes.
YUMI: You know, me and the prom.
ODD: Even if I was your date?
ULRICH: Sissi really did come on strong.
ULRICH: If meanness is one of the\Nqualities of a beauty queen,
ULRICH: she’ll get re-elected, alright.
JEREMIE: That’s true, but try to get\NMiss World to see that.
ODD: Ha-ha! Miss World, huh?
ODD: Miss In Her Own World\Nis more like it!
MILLY: At least you don’t\Ncare how old I am, do you?
MILLY: We understand each other.
MILLY: We’re not like those dumb older kids\Nwho always want to run things.
MILLY: They think that because we’re young,\Nwe don’t count at all.
MILLY: If for once we were older,\Na lot older than them,
MILLY: they wouldn’t laugh at us, would they?
TAMIYA: Milly?
TAMIYA: Are you in there?
TAMIYA: Are you finished sulking?
TAMIYA: Hurry, we have work to do!
MILLY: Okay, okay. I’m coming!
MILLY: You stay right there.
MILLY: I’ll be back for you.
TAMIYA: We have a report to finish\Non the prom, remember?
MUSIC: (SINISTER MUSIC)
SFX: (GROWLING)
SISSI: Hey, I hope you two aren’t gonna\Nfollow me around all day long.
SISSI: As far as I know,\Nyou’re not beauticians,
SISSI: so stop sticking to me like glue!
SISSI: I don’t need you, understand? So scat!
HERB: Uh…Sissi…\Nw-we thought--
SISSI: Take this advice.
SISSI: Don’t think--\Nit doesn’t suit you!
DEFAULT: -Oh.\N-Oh.
SISSI: A bunch of babies at our prom.
SISSI: They’ve gotta be kidding.
SISSI: And that other freak who had\Nthe nerve to invite Ulrich!
SISSI: Can’t believe it!
SISSI: If anybody’s going out with Ulrich,\Nit absolutely has to be me.
SISSI: I am the star--\Nthe diva of the school!
SFX: (CREAKING)
SISSI: Huh?

SISSI: Who’s there?
SISSI: Answer me! Who is it!
SISSI: (SCREAMS)
MR. DELMAS: Move along. Back to your dorms.\NEverything is just fine.
MILLY: Looks as if we’ve\Ngot ourselves a super scoop.
ODD: What do you say we take a look\Nto make sure that our old friend XANA
ODD: isn’t behind this?
YUMI: Mhmm.
ULRICH: What do you think?
JEREMIE: A simple short circuit.
JEREMIE: Too many appliances\Nplugged in at the same time.
YUMI: Yeah, the hi-fi, lights,\Nlady shaver, curling iron…
YUMI: all together, what do you\Nexpect to happen?
ODD: Not to mention\Nthe brain stimulator!
ODD: Although she probably never\Nfigured out how to use it.
JEREMIE: Hmm.
MILLY: I don’t know what happened,\Nbut if you ask me, Sissi had it coming.
TAMIYA: I couldn’tagree with you more.
MILLY: Oh, no!
MILLY: My teddy bear’s gone!
JIM: Aha!
JIM: Caught you!
JIM: It’s forbidden to play\Nin the garden shed!
MILLY: Wait a minute, Jim!\NIt was my--
JIM: I don’t want to know why.
JIM: I’ve told you a hundred times that this place\Nis much too dangerous for children.
JIM: Look at all these rusty tools!
JIM: What do you think this is,\Na kid’s playground?
MILLY: We know, but--
JIM: No buts, huh!
JIM: Now, I hope I’ve\Nmade myself real clear.
JIM: Entry forbidden.\NAccess reserved for adults.
MILLY: With you, everything is off-limits!
JIM: Now, you listen here, huh.
JIM: I would change the way I talk\Nif I were you, little girl.
MILLY: Little girl!
MILLY: Okay, I’m young, so what!
MILLY: It’s only big kids who can\Nsay what they think, huh?
JIM: Ah, so you think\Nyou’re real big kids?
JIM: Okay, that’s fine.
JIM: News report or not,
: the two of you are grounded\Nfor tonight in your room.
TAMIYA: Oh great, Milly.\NReally great.
TAMIYA: Thanks to you,\Nit’s goodbye prom.
JIM: Now, beat it!
TAMIYA: Oh, look at the pictures we’ve taked.
TAMIYA: They’re really fantastic.
ODD: Something wrong, Milly?
TAMIYA: Somebody stole our teddy bear.
MILLY: And I’m sure it’s one of\Nthe big kids who did it for spite.
TAMIYA: Milly, you’re right! Look at this!\NIt’s a picture of Sissi’s room.
MILLY: And there’s my teddy bear!\NHidden under her pillow! Incredible.
ODD: Ah, who would’ve believed it?\NSoon, she’ll be playing with dolls!
MILLY: Okay! Come on, now!\NWe gotta find her!
TAMIYA: If Jim catches us in the dorm,\Nwe’re in big trouble, Milly.
ODD: You go back to your room.\NI’ll handle this.
SFX: (RUSTLING)
JIM: What’s going on now?
JIM: Who’s there?
JIM: Come on out!
JIM: D--aah!
JIM: Y-You’d better watch out!\NI-I’m a black belt!
SFX: (GROWLING)
JIM: A-a-a-a-ah!
MR. DELMAS: And now you’re sure, Jim,\Nthat this is your attacker?
MR. DELMAS: And you say he’s\Nan expert in martial arts?
MR. DELMAS: I think it would be better\Nnot to call the police. Right, Jim?
JEREMIE: What happened to Sissi, it was…
JEREMIE: it was kind of weird, don’t you think?
ULRICH: It was a short circuit.\NA simple short circuit.
ULRICH: What else could it be?
JEREMIE: I’m not so sure, and you know\Njust what I mean.
YUMI: Anyway, let’s play it real cool.\NWalls have ears, you know.
YUMI: Well, I’ve got to go now\Nand get ready for the prom tonight.
YUMI: Sometimes, being a day student\Ncan be a total drag.
ULRICH: Don’t complain.
ULRICH: No one wakes you at 6 AM,\Nyou have hot water,
ULRICH: and you don’t have to sleep\Nnext to smelly Odd.
YUMI: See you later.
MR. DELMAS: Odd, are you looking for something?
ODD: Oh, uh, no.
ODD: You see, I just heard about\Nwhat happened to Jim.
ODD: Do they know who attacked him?
MR. DELMAS: Uh, no.
MR. DELMAS: For now, I think our gym teacher\Ncould use some rest.
ODD: (GASPS)
ULRICH: XANA? In a teddy bear?
ODD: Yeah, I’m pretty sure.
JEREMIE: He’s always there\Nwhen you least expect him.
ODD: Okay, guys.
ODD: Who goes and who stays here?
JEREMIE: We can’t have a solo mission.\NIt’s too dangerous without Yumi.
JEREMIE: If you go alone, you never know\Nwhat you’re gonna find over there.
ODD: I volunteer!
JEREMIE: What did I just say, huh?
ODD: Well, have you got any other ideas?
ODD: There have been two accidents,\Nwe can’t leave the school unguarded,
ODD: and even going back in time\Nif there’s an accident, it’s all over.
ULRICH: Odd is right.
ULRICH: You go and I’ll stay.
ULRICH: If I find any clues,\NI’ll pass them on to you.
ULRICH: Go on and say hi\Nto you know who for me.
JEREMIE: Aelita?
JEREMIE: Aelita? Aelita, it’s Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Do you read me?
AELITA: Hi there.
JEREMIE: We think that XANA\Nhas launched an attack.
JEREMIE: Have you noticed anything?
AELITA: No, nothing.
AELITA: But we can take a closer look.
JEREMIE: Aelita, I’m sending Odd.
JEREMIE: He’s coming over solo.
JEREMIE: Ulrich has to say behind
JEREMIE: to watch for any virus action at school.
JEREMIE: Odd looks ready to go.
JEREMIE: How are things with you, Ulrich?
ULRICH: It looks like we have a problem.
ULRICH: A big one.
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE: Scanner.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
ULRICH: Jeremie, it’s bad, huh.
ULRICH: The bear got out of the school.
AELITA: If it’s under XANA’s control,\Nit’ll only become much madder.
AELITA: It’ll go for anybody that’s around.
AELITA: Especially his mortal enemies. Like you.
JEREMIE: Huh!
ULRICH: Oh, Yumi!
AELITA: You see that?
AELITA: The tower that XANA has activated\Ncan’t be too far away.
ODD: Well, uh, not down there, anyway.
AELITA: Maybe on the neighboring plateaus.
ODD: Oops.
ODD: Too late.
ODD: Here come the reception committee.
JEREMIE: Odd, take good care of Aelita.
SFX: (DIAL TONE)

ULRICH: Sorry. Are your parents home?
YUMI: No, they went out.

ULRICH: You go and clear the dorms.\NI’ll take care of the gym.
ODD: We found the tower, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Great, well done!\NNow all you have to do is deactivate it.
ODD: Okay.
ODD: Just give me a minute to say hello\Nto an old buddy of mine.
JEREMIE: Cut the courtesy!
JEREMIE: You only have 50 life points left.\NYou can’t let him hit you!
JIM: Hey, Ulrich.
JIM: You could’ve made a little effort.\NI don’t believe how sloppy you look!
JIM: Well, I’ll let it go this time.\NPut it down to the company you keep.
