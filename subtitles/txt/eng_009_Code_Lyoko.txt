MRS. HERTZ: Now, then, if you provoke\Na collision between two neutrons,
MRS. HERTZ: what do you obtain?
MRS. HERTZ: Who would like to answer?
MRS. HERTZ: Anybody?
MRS. HERTZ: Nobody?
HERB: Me, mam.
MRS. HERTZ: (CELL PHONES RING)

DEFAULT: Hello?
DEFAULT: Hello?
DEFAULT: -Hello?\N-Hello?
: Who is this?
MRS. HERTZ: Sissi, you, the principal’s daughter,
MRS. HERTZ: should know the rule\Ndealing with cell phones.
MRS. HERTZ: Now, why don’t you\Nremind us all what that rule is?
SISSI: All mobile phones have got to be\Nturned off before entering the classroom
SISSI: under penalty of having them confiscated.
MRS. HERTZ: Hand it over!
MRS. HERTZ: And that goes for everyone!
STUDENTS: (STUDENTS CLAMORING)
MRS. HERTZ: Quiet down!
MRS. HERTZ: Put all your cell phones\Non my desk right now!
ODD: XANA’s sure gonna be happy about this.
DEFAULT: (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
YUMI: We had this weird problem.
YUMI: This morning, like everyone’s\Ncell phone started ringing and--
ODD: The teacher confiscated them. Us, too.
JEREMIE: Crazy, huh?
JEREMIE: All those calls\Nand no one at the other end.
JEREMIE: I think I’ll contact Aelita.\NThis could be XANA’s doing.
ULRICH: We’ve got to do something.
ULRICH: If Jeremie’s right and we can’t\Nstay in contact, we’re in a real jam.
SISSI: Hey, you three!
SISSI: I’m organizing a meeting.
SISSI: They’ve got to\Ngive us our mobiles back.
SISSI: Well, are you with us?
YUMI: You bet we are.
SISSI: Huh, no kidding?
SISSI: If you really mean it,
SISSI: we’ll see you in the\Nauditorium right after lunch.
ULRICH: You were right.\NWe’ve got to see what’s up.
JEREMIE: Connection.
JEREMIE: Aelita, do you read me?
JEREMIE: Aelita?
AELITA: Oh, hello, Jeremie.
JEREMIE: Hi.
JEREMIE: Tell me, have you noticed\Nanything strange on Lyoko?
AELITA: No, should I have?
JEREMIE: I don’t know, but I’d better\Nlaunch a scan to check.
AELITA: Okay, and I’ll see if I can\Npick up any of XANA’s pulsations.
JEREMIE: Good, but be careful.
AELITA: See you later.
YUMI: You’re gonna take back your cell phone?\NThat’s called stealing, you know that?
ODD: No it’s not! Taking back what\Nbelongs to you in the first place
ODD: is not what I would call stealing.
MR. DELMAS: The students were warned.
MR. DELMAS: I’m not going to return\Ntheir phones that quickly.
MR. DELMAS: We need to deactivate\Nthe school’s antenna.
MR. DELMAS: That way, even with new phones\Nthey won’t be able to use them.
MR. DELMAS: Can you handle that, Jim?
JIM: Huh?
ULRICH: We have no choice, Yumi.
MR. DELMAS: Thank you, Charles.
ODD: Okay, Ulrich. Let’s go.
ULRICH: The coast is clear.
ODD: Here we go.
ODD: Now, let’s see.
ULRICH: Oh, hello, Mister Lebrun!
MR. LEBRUN: Oh, hello, Ulrich.
ODD: Ha-ha! Mission accomplished!
YUMI: Let’s hope that nobody finds out.
ODD: I’d rather hope that\Nwe’re worried over nothing.
JEREMIE: For now, the scan\Nhasn’t found an activated tower.
AELITA: I haven’t seen anything either.\NFalse alarm.
JEREMIE: XANA!
ULRICH: Why would XANA be interested\Nin mobile phones, huh?
JEREMIE: That’s what I’m hoping to find out\Nby checking out the school’s antenna.
YUMI: I’m off to the meeting I promised Sissi.
JIM: Huh?
JIM: Hey, who let you guys up here?
JIM: Trying to stop me from\Ndisconnecting the antenna?
ULRICH: Us? No, uh, we were just passing by.
JEREMIE: Careful!
ULRICH: We’ll take him to the infirmary.
JEREMIE: Okay.
JEREMIE: I’ll try to find out what\NXANA’s done to the antenna.
ULRICH: Hey, Jim, can you hear me?
ODD: It smells like roast chicken, huh?
ULRICH: Jim? Hey, Jim!
ULRICH: Yoo-hoo!
MS. PERRAUDIN: Odd? Ulrich?
MS. PERRAUDIN: What are you doing here?
MS. PERRAUDIN: Jim!
: What happened to him?
ODD: Oh, you know how Jim is.\NHe’s a regular live wire, so--
ODD: Oh, I mean…
JEREMIE: The main television antenna?
MILLY: There.
SISSI: Oh, Miss Yumi is gracing us\Nwith her presence.
SISSI: Where were you when we wrote the petition?
MR. DELMAS: Just what is going on in here?
SISSI: Oh, dad--uh, I mean…
SISSI: Sir! What is going on here is this!
SISSI: You see, we all signed a petition,
SISSI: so you have to give us\Nback our cell phones.
MR. DELMAS: Oh, really?
MR. DELMAS: First, let me remind you\Nthat in this establishment,
MR. DELMAS: the students do not make the rules.
MR. DELMAS: Secondly, Misses Hertz has just learned\Nthat someone forced her locker open
MR. DELMAS: to get back his cell phone.
SISSI: It’s only normal, sir!
SISSI: How can anyone live\Nwithout their cell phone?
MR. DELMAS: I’m sorry, but this theft is another\Nreason for not returning them to you.
MR. DELMAS: And we’re going to investigate to determine
MR. DELMAS: who had the nerve to steal back his own.
SISSI: And I say we don’t set foot\Nin the classroom without our mobiles!
STUDENTS: (CHEERING)
JEREMIE: You see these waves?
JEREMIE: XANA’s using the school antenna unit\Nto try to plug into the main television dish.
YUMI: That’s why all the phones rang?
JEREMIE: Right. It jams their frequencies.
JEREMIE: If XANA manages to take control of the dish,
JEREMIE: he’ll have direct access to the satellites\Nthat are now orbiting the earth.
YUMI: And?
JEREMIE: And he’ll be able\Nto guide a military satellite.
YUMI: Okay, but for what reason?
JEREMIE: I wish I knew. In peacetime,\Nthese satellites are used for spying,
JEREMIE: but if XANA reprograms one, who knows.
ULRICH: Anything can happen.
ULRICH: Jeremie’s right, this is serious.
JEREMIE: You’d better believe it, Ulrich.
JEREMIE: The scan has detected a tower!
AELITA: Jeremie, XANA has activated\Na tower in the polar region!
JEREMIE: We’re on our way.
AELITA: Better hurry.
JEREMIE: Let’s go through the tunnel in the park.
ODD: Kiwi, you stay here.
SISSI: No more phones, no more school! Perfect!
YUMI: I’ll stay here in case XANA’s\Ngot plans to attack the school.
SISSI: Hey, are you with us or not?\NEver heard of solidarity?
YUMI: Don’t worry, Sissi,\NI’m with you 100 percent.
YUMI: No more phones, no more school!\NNo more phones--
SISSI: Okay, let’s go!
ODD: Kiwi, what are you doing here?
JEREMIE: Incredible. For a dog,\N he’s stubborn as a mule.
ODD: Well, now that you’re here, come on.
ODD: Yeah!
JEREMIE: Aelita’s on her way to the polar region.
JEREMIE: Aelita?
AELITA: Jeremie, I made it to the ice flow,\Nbut I don’t see any activated tower.
JEREMIE: Okay, wait there for Ulrich and Odd,\Nand watch out for XANA’s monsters.
JEREMIE: Well, are you ready?
JEREMIE: Here we go.
JEREMIE: Transfer Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Transfer Odd.
JEREMIE: Scanner Odd.
JEREMIE: Scanner Ulrich.
JEREMIE: Virtualization.
AELITA: Odd! Ulrich!
ULRICH: There she is.
JEREMIE: Good news.
JEREMIE: XANA’s still not in control of the TV dish.
JEREMIE: That gives us a little time.
JEREMIE: I’ll try to find out which satellite\NXANA might want to get his hands on,
JEREMIE: but it won’t be easy.
STUDENTS: No more phones,\Nno more school!
DEFAULT: No more phones,\Nno more school!
DEFAULT: No more phones,\Nno more school!
DEFAULT: No more phones,\Nno more school!
JEREMIE: Okay, now let’s try the access code.
JEREMIE: Access code accepted.
JEREMIE: Yes!
JEREMIE: Bingo!
JEREMIE: Let’s see…U466.
JEREMIE: Military satellite armed with…
JEREMIE: a highly-destructive laser beam!
ODD: Where can that tower be?
JEREMIE: One thing at a time, Odd.
JEREMIE: First of all, I figured it out.
JEREMIE: I know what XANA’s after.
JEREMIE: He wants to gain control\Nof a highly-accurate
JEREMIE: and destructive satellite.
JEREMIE: If he does, he can destroy\Nwhatever he wants.
ODD: The factory’s safe.\NXANA wouldn’t fire at himself.
JEREMIE: Right.
JEREMIE: That’ll give us time to\Ntake care of things on Lyoko.
ULRICH: Sounds good.
ULRICH: But if XANA decides\Nto destroy the school…
JEREMIE: Remember, YumI’s there,\Nso that’s for sure what he’s gonna do.
JEREMIE: We have to warn her.
JEREMIE: But without a mobile…
STUDENTS: No more phones,\Nno more school!
STUDENTS: No more phones,\Nno more school!
STUDENTS: No more phones, no more--
MR. DELMAS: I demand that you stop\Nthis absurd strike now!
YUMI: Kiwi?
MR. DELMAS: Yumi, what is going on?
YUMI: Well, I--
MR. DELMAS: This is inadmissible!
MR. DELMAS: To my office! Immediately!
SISSI: Did you see that?
SISSI: We have to save her\Nfrom the dictator!
SISSI: Free Yumi!
SISSI: Liberty for Yumi!
SISSI: Free Yumi! Free Yumi!
SISSI: Free Yumi! Free Yumi!
JEREMIE: According to the holomap,\Nthe tower is just across the bridge.
JEREMIE: But be careful.
JEREMIE: It’s probably guarded by those…
ULRICH: By the waspsters.\NThanks, we’ve noticed.
JEREMIE: Remember, the poison they’re carrying
JEREMIE: will kill your life points, so watch out.
ODD: What are they waiting for?
JEREMIE: They must just want to hold you there
JEREMIE: until XANA’s able to control the satellite.
JEREMIE: You’ve got to get past them.
ODD: Laser arrow!
ULRICH: No, Aelita! Watch out!
JEREMIE: Aelita, don’t take any chances.\NLeave that to Odd and Ulrich.
MR. DELMAS: Yumi, I don’t understand! What’s going on?
MR. DELMAS: A strike, a dog…
MR. DELMAS: You’re usually so sensible, too.
MR. DELMAS: Yumi, will you listen to me?
YUMI: I’m sorry, sir, but I\Nhave to leave right away.
YUMI: You too, as a matter of fact!
YUMI: Everyone around here has to leave!
JEREMIE: We have no choice.
JEREMIE: One of you has to make the sacrifice.
ODD: Listen, I’ll attract their attention\Nso you can get through.
ODD: Here I go.
ULRICH: Odd, wait!
ODD: Take that!
ULRICH: He’s nuts.
ULRICH: Okay, let’s go.
ODD: Yeah, take that!
ODD: Ow!
ODD: Ow!
JEREMIE: Odd, between the poison and the arrows
JEREMIE: you’ve already lost seven life points!
ODD: You said no choice!
ODD: There, you horrible beast!
JEREMIE: You’ve only got 20 life points left, Odd!
JEREMIE: I’m sorry.
JEREMIE: Oh, no. XANA’s taken over the satellite!
JEREMIE: Hurry!
SISSI: He let you go, Yumi?
YUMI: I escaped when he wasn’t looking.
SISSI: What?
YUMI: Because our…
YUMI: our demands are more important\Nthan anything for me!
YUMI: In fact, we should increase\Nthe strength of our movement
YUMI: and protest in town!
YUMI: Everyone, into town!
YUMI: We’ve got to get\Nall the schools on our side!
SISSI: Okay!
SISSI: Let’s go! Freedom for\Nall our schools! Come on!
STUDENTS: No more phones,\Nno more school!
STUDENTS: No more phones,\Nno more school!
JEREMIE: Wow, what an incredible\Ntechnological masterpiece.
DEFAULT: Parameters locked in place. Target localized.
JEREMIE: Already?
JEREMIE: We were right.
JEREMIE: The school’s in the satellite’s line of fire.
JEREMIE: But…
STUDENTS: High school students,\Nmiddle school students,
STUDENTS: all for one and one for all!
YUMI: Come on, come on, faster!
MR. DELMAS: You will not leave the grounds.
SISSI: You have no right!
ULRICH: What’s going on?
ULRICH: I thought the tower\Nwas supposed to be here.
JEREMIE: 10 life points left.
ODD: Ulrich, it’s game over for me.
JEREMIE: Oh, no.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, Aelita,\Nthe waspsters are after you!
JEREMIE: The holomap doesn’t lie.\NIt’s got to be here somewhere.
ULRICH: Triplicate!
ULRICH: Go on, don’t worry about me.
JEREMIE: I wonder how accurate\Nthis satellite really is.
JEREMIE: I don’t believe it.
JEREMIE: Yumi’s in danger!
JEREMIE: The laser’s aimed right at her!
YUMI: You’re making a terrible mistake!
YUMI: I beg of you, sir, we’ve all\Ngot to get out of here!
MR. DELMAS: I have had enough, Yumi.
MR. DELMAS: I’m suspending you for a month.
MR. DELMAS: You and your dog\Nare to leave this campus now.
MR. DELMAS: As for the rest of you,\Nback to your classrooms.
MR. DELMAS: This strike is over!
YUMI: Sir, it’s a question of life and death!
YUMI: Let us all leave, please!
SISSI: Hey, aren’t you being\Na little dramatic, Yumi?
ODD: Yumi!
ODD: To the factory! Hurry!\NIt’s you the satellite’s after!
COMPUTER VOICE: Laser flight path locked.
COMPUTER VOICE: Satellite ready to fire.
JEREMIE: It’s all over. XANA’s gonna fire!
ODD: Come on, we have to reach the factory.
ODD: It’s the only place that’s safe.
MR. DELMAS: What in the world is happening?
MR. DELMAS: Let’s get out of here now!
ULRICH: Aelita, have you found it yet?
ULRICH: Time’s running out!
AELITA: I’m doing my best,\Nbut nothing yet.
AELITA: It’s pretty well hidden.
JEREMIE: Ulrich, Aelita, answer me!
AELITA: I’m here, Jeremie, but Ulrich’s out cold.
AELITA: I still haven’t found the tower.
AELITA: Ulrich, can you hear me?
ULRICH: Yes, Aelita.
ULRICH: Have you found the tower yet?
AELITA: I think I have.
ULRICH: Okay, go.
AELITA: Jeremie, I found it!
ODD: To the boiler room. Ready?
YUMI: It’s now or never. Let’s go.
ODD: Yumi!
ODD: No!
JEREMIE: Return to the past now.
SISSI: Invitations to a party?
ODD: Not really.
SISSI: What is this thing?
SISSI: “Official school policy\Nreminder to all students.
SISSI: “All mobile phones not turned off\Nbefore entering the classroom
SISSI: “will be immediately confiscated?”
SISSI: That’s incredible.\NTalk about teacher’s pets!
SISSI: Anyway, I’d like to see someone\Ntry to confiscate my mobile.
HERB: You’re so brazen!
