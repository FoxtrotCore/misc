Update Details: After Jeremy makes another failed attempt to materialize Aelita, a student named Taelia arrives at school that looks exactly like her. Jeremy is convinced that it must be her, but she seems to have no memory of her experiences with the group. The others are not quite as convinced, but Jeremy insists that the materialization process must have caused her to lose her memory, but the others were right.
